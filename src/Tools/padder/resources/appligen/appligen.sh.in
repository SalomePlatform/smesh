# This script installs or updates a SALOME application for testing the
# PADDER plugin for SMESH. The application is installed in the
# directory ./appli. The configuration file is supposed to be adapted
# to your own environment (see config_appli.xml).
#
# To run this script, you should have first configure your
# shell with the SALOME environment, i.e. source the files
# prerequis.sh and envSalome.sh (or equivalent) that fit
# your configuration. You can alternatively customize the env.sh file
# to fit your SALOME environment and let the script do the job (see
# source below).
