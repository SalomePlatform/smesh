\section S1_PADDER The SpherePadder Algorithm

SpherePadder is a geometric algorithm that creates a set of rigid
spherical particles of different sizes called a "discrete element
mesh". The centroid positions of particles are randomly generated by a
"disordering" technique described in [1] that provides a polydisperse
assembly with a particular size distribution. The spheres are
positioned or “padded” into a tetrahedral mesh, which must be
generated first. As illustrated below, SpherePadder creates a Discrete
Element (DE) assembly in seven steps (see [1] for details):

In order to increase the density of the whole packing and to fill
spheres in the gaps close to the mesh boundaries (created by removing
boundary spheres), SpherePadder detect `void spaces' where new spheres
could be added by applying a particular geometric procedure, using
tetrahedra resulting from a tridimensional Delaunay triangulation
built with the sphere centers. That triangulation is generated by
using the CGAL library [2]. 

DE meshes generated by SpherePadder algorithm are used in EUROPLEXUS
fast dynamics software simulations [3] to model the discontinuous
behaviour (fractures, fragmentation) of reinforced concrete structures
under severe dynamic loads such as impacts or explosions. The
characteristic size of elements does not have to be representative of
concrete constituents, such as granulars or cement matrix, since the
aim is to reproduce the dynamic behaviour of the simulated material at
the macroscopic scale. 

To generate DE mesh for a reinforced concrete structure, one should
supply a single tetrahedral mesh for concrete and as many segment-type
1D meshes as groups of steel reinforcement bars of different
diameters. The size (length) of segment-type steel reinforcement
elements should correspond to the modelled bar’s
diameter. SpherePadder algorithm will create steel discrete elements
by using the segment’s length as the DE diameter.

Warning: The User should control that all steel bars of a given
diameter in a mesh belong to the same mesh group, and that different
steel bar groups do not use the same diameter.

If steel mesh is not provided, a pure concrete DE mesh is generated.

In MED representation, DE meshes are described by using MED_BALL type
structural elements. Each MED_BALL element is defined by its centroid
location and a diameter.

\section S2_PADDER The SpherePadder SALOME plugin

The SpherePadder algorithm is implemented as an external software
program. This external program is integrated in the SMESH module as a
SALOME plugin that manage the execution of the SpherePadder program
from within the SALOME framework. This section illustrates how to use
this plugin to create a discrete element mesh.

In this example, we consider a concrete piece with a single
reinforcement bars group. Thus, two standard (Finite Element type)
meshes have been created and published in the study, the first one
named “concrete”, and second one named "ferrail", for the steel bars
part: 

\image html padder_image03.png

The SpherePadder plugin can be activated in the SMESH plugins menu, as
illustrated on the figure below: 

\image html padder_image04.png

When clicking on the "PADDER mesher" item, the graphical interface of
the SpherePadder plugin appears:

\image html padder_image05.png

This interface invites you to specify input data by pressing the
button "Input". This command opens the Input dialog box allowing to
specify the list and the type of selected meshes (to be chosen between
"concrete" and "steelbar" using the combobox on the right side of the
input line): 

\image html padder_image06.png

In the figure below, the mesh with name "concrete" has been selected
in the study and added to the list of the input file as a "concrete
mesh". First, you have to choose the mesh in the dialog box using the
rounded arrow icon, then specify for this mesh a group name which will
be published in the final DE mesh, and finally click on the "Add"
icon: 

\image html padder_image07.png

Then, the mesh with name "ferrail" is selected and added to the list
as a "steelbar mesh": 

\image html padder_image08.png

The input dialog box has to be validated to return to the main plugin
interface. The "Compute" button is now enabled, indicating that the
problem is ready to be computed: 

\image html padder_image09.png

The command "Compute" starts the job run. The progression can be
requested using the command "Refresh". In the figure below, the job is
still running: 

\image html padder_image10.png

Finally, the job is finished and the result is ready to be published
in the SALOME study: 

\image html padder_image11.png

Click on the button "Publish" to import the resulting MED file into
SMESH and publish the resulting mesh in the SALOME study: 

\image html padder_image12.png

Note that the final ED mesh contains as many groups as the input
meshes. Their names have been specified in the input dialog. 

A new functionality has been added to SpherePadder allowing to mesh
curved geometries. Circular objects with concave boundaries such as 
shown here:

\image html padder_curvedgeom.png

can be "padded" with spherical discrete elements. Henceforward, 
the PointSprite (sphere-like) mode is used to show the MED_BALL 
elements with their real diameters:

\section S3_PADDER Configuring the SpherePadder SALOME plugin

The configuration of the plugin consists in specifying the location of
the padder executable program (padder.exe) and its runtime environment
file (padder.env). This configuration is automatically done at
installation process of the SALOME plateform, on the basis of the
environment variable PADDERHOME that localizes the installation root
of the SpherePadder external program. This installation process
creates a configuration file padder.cfg located in the folder
\<SMESH_ROOT_DIR\>/share/salome/plugins/smesh, where \<SMESH_ROOT_DIR\> is
the installation root directory of the SMESH module.

In the case where you have to specify a different configuration than
the generated configuration, you must edit the file padder.cfg. This
file defines a list of computing resources, and at least a local
resource (a padder program working on your local host), and a remote
resource (a padder program working on a remote host):

\code
# This section specify the configurations to be used respectively for
# the local execution and the remote execution. The value for 'local'
# and 'remote' keys must be the name of a configuration section in
# this file. The default key must specify a value between "local" or
# "remote" to indicate the user preference. 
[resources]
local   = localhost
remote  = nepal

[preferences]
defaultres = local

# The following sections defines the available configurations.
# The name of the section can be choosen arbitrary. But the value of
# the resname key MUST be the name of a SALOME resource defined in the
# catalog of resources (CatalogResources.xml).

# For each section:
# - resname : the name of the SALOME resource to be used in this configuration
# - binpath : the path to the padder executable program on this resource
# - envpath : the path to the environment file on this resource
[localhost]
resname = localhost
binpath = /home/.programs/salome/workspace/V6_4_BR/SMESH/install/share/salome/resources/smesh/padderexe/padder.exe
envpath = /home/.programs/salome/workspace/V6_4_BR/SMESH/install/share/salome/resources/smesh/padderexe/envPadder.sh

[nepal]
resname = nepal@nepal
binpath = /usr/local/bin/padder.exe
envpath = /usr/local/share/envPadder.sh
\endcode

The resource labels (localhost and nepal in the above example) must
correspond to existing computing resources of SALOME. These resources
are specified in the SALOME configuration CatalogResources.xml,
located at the root directory of your SALOME application. The
resources catalog is supposed to contain at least the localhost
resource of type 'ssh' defined as follow:

\code
<!DOCTYPE ResourcesCatalog>
<resources>

   <!-- Generic configuration that should works on every workstation -->
   <machine name="localhost" hostname="localhost"
            protocol="ssh" batch="ssh_batch"
            memInMB="500" CPUFreqMHz="0" nbOfNodes="1" nbOfProcPerNode="1"/>

</resources>
\endcode

Note that these SALOME computing resources can be graphically edited
using the JOBMANAGER module (see JOBMANAGER documentation).

The typical error message when trying to use the padder plugin while
the localhost resource is not correctly defined is :

\code
ERR: the job with jobid = 0 can't be started
ERR: No batchmanager for that cluster - Bad batch description of the resource"
\endcode

This error message is display in the graphical interface of the plugin
when you request a computing of your mesh:

\image html padder_error_noresource.png

Another typical error when using the padder plugin is due to the ssh
configuration between your client host and the execution host:

\code
ERR: the job with jobid = 0 can't be started
ERR: Error of connection on remote host ! status = 65280
\endcode

This error message is display in the graphical interface of the plugin
when you request a computing of your mesh:

\image html padder_error_noconnection.png

The underlying batch system for executing padder jobs is based on a
ssh communication between the client local host and the execution host
(see the protocol specified in the CatalogResources.xml file above),
even if the executive host is your local host (i.e. the same as the
client host). Then, a ssh connection must be configured so that the
underlying batch system could work properly, even between your local
host and itself. The configuration could be done using a set of
instruction as follow in a shell terminal (see ssh documentation for
details):

\code 
ssh-keygen
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <username>@<hostname>
\endcode

You can check the configuration by testing that you can connect to the
host \<hostname\> with the login \<username\> without being asked a
password:

\code 
ssh <username>@<hostname>
\endcode
