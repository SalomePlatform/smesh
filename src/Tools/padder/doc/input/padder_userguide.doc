\section S1_PADDER The PADDER Algorithm

PADDER is an algorithm that creates a set of particules called a "discrete mesh".
The particules are characterized by a location in space and a weight that can be considered
as the radius of a sphere whose center is the location of the particule.

Discrete meshes are typically used to modelize civil components in rapid dynamic
computation problems (seisms, chocs). These components consists in concrete parts
embedding steal bares for reinforcement. These parts are input to the algorithm
as standard finite elements meshes. The cells of theses meshes drive the location
and sizing of particules.

In the med representation, a discrete mesh is described as MED_BALL elements.
A MED_BALL element is defined by a location and a radius.

\section S2_PADDER The PADDER SALOME plugin

The PADDER algoritm is integrated in the module SMESH as a SALOME
plugin. This section illustrates how to use this plugin to create a
discrete mesh.

In this example, we suppose that two standard meshes (Finite Elements
Meshes) have been created and publish in the study to modelize the
concrete part (here with the name "concrete") and the steal bars part
(here with the name "ferrail"):

The PADDER plugin can be invoked from the SMESH plugins menu, as
illustrated on the figure below:

When you clic on the "PADDER mesher" item, the graphical interface of
the PADDER plugin appears:

This interface invites you to specify input data by pressing the button
"Input". This command opens the Input dialog box to specify the list
of meshes and the type of the selected meshes (to be choosen between
"concrete" or "steelbar" using the combobox on the right side of the
input line):

In the figure below, the mesh with name "concrete" has been selected
in the study and added in the list of input file as a "concrete
mesh". You have to input the mesh in the dialog using the rounded
arrow icon, then specify a group name (the name of the group of
MED_BALL created for this mesh in the resulting mesh), and finnaly
clic on the "Add" icon:

Then, the mesh with name "ferrail" is selected and added to the list
as a "steelbar mesh":

The input dialog box can be validated toreturn to the main plugin
interface. The "Compute" button is now enable, indicating that the
problem is ready to be computed:

\image html SMESH_spadder_plugindialog_compute_ready.png

The command "Compute" start the job. The progression can be requested
using the command "Refresh". In the figure below, the job is still
running:

\image html SMESH_spadder_plugindialog_compute_running.png

Finally, the job is finished and the result is ready to be published
in the SALOME study:

\image html SMESH_spadder_plugindialog_compute_finished.png

Clic on the command "Publish" to explicitly import the resulting med
file in SMESH and published the resulting mesh in the SALOME study:

\image html SMESH_spadder_plugindialog_published.png

Note that this mesh contains one group for each of the input mesh. A
group with the name specified in the input dialog has been defined for
the set of MED_BALL created from the corresponding input mesh:

\section S3_PADDER Configuring the plugin

The configuration of the plugin consists in specifying the location of
the padder executable program for each of the SALOME resource (at
least for the localhost resource). This specification is done in the
file padder.cfg, located in the plugin installation folder
(i.e. <SMESH_ROOT_DIR>/plugins):

\code
# This section specify the configurations to be used respectively for
# the local execution and the remote execution. The value for 'local'
# and 'remote' keys must be the name of a configuration section in
# this file. The default key must specify a value between "local" or
# "remote" to indicate the user preference. 
[resources]
local   = localhost
remote  = nepal

[preferences]
defaultres = local

# The following sections defines the available configurations.
# The name of the section can be choosen arbitrary. But the value of
# the resname key MUST be the name of a SALOME resource defined in the
# catalog of resources (CatalogResources.xml).

# For each section:
# - resname : the name of the SALOME resource to be used in this configuration
# - binpath : the path to the padder executable program on this resource
# - envpath : the path to the environment file on this resource
[localhost]
resname = localhost
binpath = /home/.programs/salome/workspace/V6_4_BR/SMESH/install/share/salome/resources/smesh/padderexe/padder.exe
envpath = /home/.programs/salome/workspace/V6_4_BR/SMESH/install/share/salome/resources/smesh/padderexe/envPadder.sh

[nepal]
resname = nepal@nepal
binpath = /usr/local/bin/padder.exe
envpath = /usr/local/share/envPadder.sh
\endcode
