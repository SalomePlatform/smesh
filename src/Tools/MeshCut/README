                 ---------------------------------
                 
MeshCut allows to cut a mesh constituted of linear tetrahedrons by a plane.
The tetrahedrons intersected by the plane are cut and replaced by elements of various types,
(tetrahedron, pyramid, pentahedron).

MeshCut is a standalone program, reading and producing med files.                
                 
Syntax:

MeshCut input.med output.med resuMeshName aboveGroup belowGroup nx ny nz px py pz T

where:
  input.med    = name of the original mesh file in med format
  output.med   = name of the result mesh file in med format
  resuMeshName = name of the result mesh
  aboveGroup   = name of the group of volumes above the cut plane
  belowGroups  = name of the group of volumes below the cut plane
  nx ny nz     = vector normal to the cut plane
  px py pz     = a point of the cut plane
  T            = 0 < T < 1 : vertices of a tetrahedron are considered as belonging to
                 the cut plane if their distance to the plane is inferior to L*T
                 where L is the mean edge size of the tetrahedron
