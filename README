About SALOME Mesh
*****************

SALOME Mesh module implements the functionalities for:
- Creating meshes in different ways:
  * By meshing geometrical models previously created or imported by the Geometry
    component;
  * Bottom-up, using mesh edition operations, especially extrusion and revolution;
  * By generation of the 3D mesh from the 2D mesh (the latter can be either imported
    or manually created).
- Importing and exporting meshes in various formats.
- Modifying meshes with a vast array of dedicated operations.
- Creating groups of mesh elements.
- Filtering mesh entities (nodes or elements) using Filters functionality for
  creating groups and applying mesh modifications.
- Viewing meshes in the VTK viewer and getting info on mesh and its sub-objects.
- Applying to meshes Quality Controls, allowing to highlight important elements.
- Taking various measurements of the mesh objects.

--------------
Pre-requisites
--------------

SALOME platform relies on a set of third-party softwares; some of them are needed
at build time only, while other ones are needed in runtime also.

For more information about the pre-requisites please visit SALOME platform web
site:

* Check Release Notes and Software Requirements of the latest SALOME release at

  <http://www.salome-platform.org/downloads/current-version/>

* Pre-requisites page at SALOME web site:

  <http://www.salome-platform.org/downloads/license/>

Note: SALOME Mesh module needs SALOME KERNEL, SALOME GUI and SALOME Geometry as
pre-requisites.

------------------
Basic Installation
------------------

The build procedure of the SALOME platform is implemented with CMake.
In order to build the module you have to do the following actions: 

1. Set up environment for pre-requisites (see "Pre-requisites" section above).

2. Create a build directory:

   % mkdir SMESH_BUILD

3. Configure the build procedure:

   % cd SMESH_BUILD
   % cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=<mode> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_directory> <path_to_src_dir>

   where
   - <mode> is either Release or Debug (default: Release);
   - <installation_directory> is a destination folder to install SALOME Mesh
      module (default: /usr); 
   - <path_to_src_dir> is a path to the SALOME Mesh sources directory.

   Note: by default (if CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX option is not given), SALOME Mesh
   module will be configured for installation to the /usr directory that requires
   root permissions to complete the installation.

4. Build and install:

   % make
   % make install

   This will install SALOME Mesh module to the <installation_directory>
   specified to cmake command on the previous step.

-------------------
Custom installation
-------------------

SALOME Mesh module supports a set of advanced configuration options;
for more details learn CMakeLists.txt file in the root source directory.

You can also use other options of cmake command to customize your installation.
Learn more about available options by typing

   % cmake --help
