This folder contains test scripts for SMESH module.

These tests are exported into the ${SMESH_ROOT_DIR}/bin/test folder and can be executed with the
`salome test` command, as a part of whole testing procedure.

The example Python scripts to be used in the documentation of Mesh module, must be put into the
{root_src}/doc/examples folder!
