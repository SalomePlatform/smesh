This folder contains example Python scripts which are used in the documentation of Mesh module,
i.e. those mentioned in *.rst files in {root_src}/doc/gui folder.

These tests are exported into the ${SMESH_ROOT_DIR}/share/doc/salome/examples folder and can be
executed with the `salome test` command, as a part of whole testing procedure.

Other Python scripts aimed for testing purposes must be put into the ${root_src}/test folder!
