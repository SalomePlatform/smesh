"The Mesh module provides a set of predefined point marker shapes which "
"can be used to display points in the 3D viewer. Each standard point "
"marker has two attributes: type (defines shape form) and scale factor "
"(defines shape size)."

"It is also possible to load a point marker shape from an external file. "
"This file should provide a description of the point texture as a set of "
"lines; each line is represented as a sequence of \"0\" and \"1\" symbols,"
" where \"1\" symbol means an opaque pixel and \"0\" symbol means a "
"transparent pixel. The width of the texture corresponds to the length of "
"the longest line in the file, expanded to the nearest byte-aligned value."
" The height of the texture is equal to the number of non-empty lines in "
"the file. Note that missing symbols are replaced by \"0\"."
