"This algorithm applies to the meshing of a hollow 3D shape, i.e. such "
"shape should be composed of two meshed shells: an outer shell and an "
"internal shell without intersection with the outer shell. One of the "
"shells should be a 2D Projection of the other shell. The meshes of the "
"shells can consist both of triangles and quadrangles."
