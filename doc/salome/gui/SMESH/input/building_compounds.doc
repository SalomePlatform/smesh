<ul>
<li>\b Name - allows selecting the name of the resulting \b Compound.</li>
<li>\b Meshes - allows selecting the meshes which will be
concatenated. They can be chosen in the Object Browser while holding
\b Ctrl button.</li>
<li><b>Processing identical groups</b> - allows selecting the method
of processing the namesake existing on the united meshes.
\n They can be either</li>
<ul>
<li>\b United - all elements of Group1 on Mesh_1 and Group1 on Mesh_2
become the elements of Group1 on the Compound_Mesh, or</li>
<li>\b Renamed - Group1 on Mesh_1 becomes Group1_1 and Group1 on Mesh_2
becomes Group1_2. See \ref grouping_elements_page "Creating Groups"
for more information about groups.</li>
</ul>
<li><b>Create common groups for initial meshes</b> checkbox permits to
automatically create groups of all elements of the same type
(nodes, edges, faces and volumes) for the resulting mesh from the
elements
of the initial meshes.
</li>
<li>You can simply unite meshes or choose to <b>Merge coincident nodes
and elements</b>, in which case it is possible to define the \b Tolerance
for this operation.</li>
</ul>
