\page building_compounds_page Building Compound Meshes

\n Compound Mesh is a combination of several meshes. All elements and
groups present in input meshes are present in the compound
mesh. Neither geometry nor hypotheses of initial meshes are used by
the compound mesh. No link between input meshes and a compound mesh is
supported, so that modification of an input mesh does not lead to
update of the compound mesh.

<em>To Build a compound mesh:</em>

\par
From the \b Mesh menu select <b>Build Compound</b> or click <em>"Build
  Compound Mesh"</em> button in the toolbar.

<center><em>"Build Compound Mesh" button</em></center>

\par
The following dialog box will appear:

\par
<ul>
  <li>\b Name - allows selecting the name of the resulting \b Compound mesh.</li>
  <li><b>Meshes, sub-meshes, groups</b> - allows selecting the meshes,
    sub-meshes and groups which will be concatenated. They can be
    chosen in the Object Browser while holding \b Ctrl button.</li>
  <li><b>Processing identical groups</b> - allows selecting the method
    of processing the namesake groups existing in the input meshes.
    They can be either <ul>
      <li>\b United - all elements of Group1 of Mesh_1 and Group1 of Mesh_2
        become the elements of Group1 of the Compound_Mesh, or</li>
      <li>\b Renamed - Group1 of Mesh_1 becomes Group1_1 and Group1 of Mesh_2
        becomes Group1_2.</li>
    </ul>
    See \ref grouping_elements_page "Creating Groups" for more information
    about groups.</li>
  <li><b>Create groups from input objects</b> check-box permits to
    automatically create groups corresponding to every initial mesh.

  <li>You can choose to additionally
    \ref merging_nodes_page "Merge coincident nodes" 
    \ref merging_elements_page "and elements" in the compound mesh, in
    which case it is possible to define the \b Tolerance for this
    operation.</li>
</ul>
