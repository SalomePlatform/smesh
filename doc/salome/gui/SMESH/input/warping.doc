\n \b Warping indicates that a face is not planar and is applied only to
2D elements with 4 nodes. This quality control criterion is based on a
projection plane created by:
<ol>
<li>bisecting the four element edges,</li>
<li>creating a point on the plane at the vector average of the
corners, where the x-axis extends from the point to the bisector on
edge 2.</li>
</ol>
The plane normal is in the direction of the cross product of the
x-axis and the vector from the origin to the bisector of edge 3. Every
corner of the quad will then be a distance ?h? from the plane. The
length of each half edge is measured and the shortest length is
assigned ?l?. The warp angle is the arcsine of the ratio of the
projection height ?h? to the half edge length ?l?.

<em>To apply the Warping quality criterion to your mesh:</em>
<ol>
<li>Display your mesh in the viewer.</li>

<li>Choose <b>Controls > Face Controls > Warping Angle</b> or click
<em>"Warping angle"</em> button of the toolbar.

Your mesh will be displayed in the viewer with its elements colored
according to the applied mesh quality control criterion:
