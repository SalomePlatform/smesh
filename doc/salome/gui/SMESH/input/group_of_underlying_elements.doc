\page group_of_underlying_elements_page Group Based on Nodes of Other Groups


To create a standalone group of entities basing on nodes of existing
reference groups, in the \b Mesh menu select <b>Group of underlying entities</b>.

The following dialog box will appear:

\image html dimgroup_dlg.png

In this dialog box specify <ul>
  <li> the resulting <b>Group name</b>, </li>
  <li> the <b>Elements Type</b> of entities of the resulting group,</li>
  <li> the criterion of inclusion of a mesh entity to the result group,
    which is <b>Number of common nodes</b> of the entity and the
    reference groups: <ul>
      <li>\b All - include if all nodes are common;</li>
      <li>\b Main - include if all corner nodes are common (meaningful for
        a quadratic mesh) </li>
      <li><b>At least one</b> - include if one or more nodes are common</li>
      <li>\b Majority - include if half or more nodes are common</li></ul>
  </li>
  <li> select reference groups,</li>
  <li> If <b>Include underlying entities only</b> option is activated
  an entity can be included if it is based on nodes of
  one element of a reference group.</li>
</ul>

In the figure below, there are two reference Volume groups:

In this case the following results for Faces, Edges and Nodes are obtained:
