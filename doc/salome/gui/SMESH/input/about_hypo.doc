\page about_hypo_page About Hypotheses

\b Hypotheses represent boundary conditions which will be taken into
account by meshing algorithms.
The hypotheses allow you to manage the level of detail of
the resulting mesh: when applying different hypotheses
with different parameters you can preset the quantity or size of
elements which will compose your mesh. So, it will be possible to
generate a coarse or a more refined mesh.

The choice of a hypothesis depends on the selected algorithm.

Hypotheses are created during creation and edition of 
\ref constructing_meshes_page "meshes" and
\ref constructing_submeshes_page "sub-meshes". 
Once created a hypotheses can be reused during creation and edition of
other meshes and sub-meshes. All created hypotheses and algorithms are
present in the Object Browser in \a Hypotheses and \a Algorithms
folders correspondingly. It is possible to open a dialog to modify the
parameters of a hypothesis from its context menu. This menu also
provides \b Unassign command that will unassign the hypothesis from
all meshes and sub-meshes using it. Modification of any parameter of a
hypothesis and its unassignment leads to automatic removal of elements
generated using it.

In \b MESH there are the following Basic Hypotheses:
<ul>
