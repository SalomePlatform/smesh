\page blsurf_hypo_page BLSURF Parameters hypothesis

\n BLSURF Parameters hypothesis works only with <b>BLSURF</b> 2d
algorithm. This algorithm is a commercial software.

<ul>
<li><b>Name</b> - allows to define the name of the hypothesis (BLSURF
Parameters by default).</li>

<li><b>Topology</b> - allows creation of a conform mesh on a shell of
not sewed faces. 
<ul>
  <li>"From CAD" means that mesh conformity is assured by conformity
  of a shape.</li>
  <li>"Pre-process" and "Pre-process++" let BLSURF software
  pre-process the geometrical model to eventually produce a conform
  mesh. </li>
</ul>

<li><b>Physical Mesh</b> - if is set to "Custom", allows to set size
of mesh elements to generate.
</li>

<li><b>User size</b> - size of mesh elements to generate. </li>

<li><b>Geometrical mesh</b> - if is set to "Custom", allows to set
mesh element deflection from curves and surfaces and element
size change rate. </li>

<li><b>Angle Mesh S</b> - maximal allowed angle in degrees at a mesh
  node between
<ul>
  <li> the mesh edge and the tangent to the geometrical curve. </li>
  <li> the mesh face and the tangent to the geometrical surface. </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><b>Gradation</b> - maximal allowed ratio between the lengths of
two adjacent edges. </li>

<li><b>Allow Quadrangles</b> - to create quadrilateral elements.</li>

<li><b>Patch independent</b> - if this box is checked on, geometrical
edges are not respected and all geometrical faces are meshed as one
hyper-face.</li>


</ul>
