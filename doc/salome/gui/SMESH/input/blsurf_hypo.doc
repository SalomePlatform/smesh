<li><b>Physical Mesh</b> - can be set to None, Custom or Size Map
 <ul>
  <li>if set to "Custom", allows user input in the
in <b>User size</b>, <b>Max Physical Size</b> and <b>Min Physical

<h1>Advanced parameters</h1>

The notion of <i>diag</i> used in the descriptions means the diagonal of the bounding box of the 
geometrical object to mesh.

\image html blsurf_parameters_advanced.png

<li><b>Verbosity level</b> - Defines the percentage of "verbosity" of
BLSURF [0-100].</li>

<li><b>Topology</b> - allows creation of a conform mesh on a shell of
not sewed faces. 
<ul>
  <li>"From CAD" means that mesh conformity is assured by conformity
  of a shape.</li>
  <li>"Pre-process" and "Pre-process++" allow the BLSURF software to
  pre-process the geometrical model to eventually produce a conform
  mesh. </li>
  <li>"PreCAD" is an auxiliary CAD pre-processing module which has 
  two main goals:
  <ul>
    <li> Complete missing or inadequate CAD descriptions.</li>
    <li> Perform topology reconstruction and specific geometry 
    enhancement for mesh generation.</li>
  </ul>
  This module requires a specific licence.
  \n
  The following PreCAD options are the most significant and important ones:
  <ul>
  <li><b>Merge Edges</b> - allows PreCAD to optimize the geometry by merging some
  edges. This option is 0 by default.</li>
  <li><b>Remove nano edges</b> - allows PreCAD to optimize the geometry by removing 
  the nano edges whenever possible. This option is 0 by default.</li>
  <li><b>Nano edge length</b> - gives the length below which an edge is considered as nano 
  for the topology processing. See also the \b remove_nano_edges option. If unset, PreCAD
  default value is \f$\mathrm{diag} \times 10^{-5}\f$.</li>
  <li><b>Discard input topology</b> - computes the CAD topology from scratch, 
  without considering the toplogical information contained in the original CAD
  (Useful for iges files). This option is 0 by default.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<li><b>ExportGMF</b> - saves the computed mesh into a GMF file (.mesh or .meshb).</li>

<li><b>Add option</b> - provides the choice of multiple PreCAD and BLSURF 
advanced options, which appear, if selected, in a table where it is 
possible to input the value of the option and to edit it later.</li>

<li><b>Clear option</b> - removes the option selected in the table.</li>

The following BLSURF options are commonly usable.

<ul>
<li>\b topo_eps1 (real) - is the tolerance level inside a CAD
patch. By default is equal to \f$\mathrm{diag} \times 10^{-4}\f$. This tolerance is used to
identify nodes to merge within one geometrical face when \b Topology
option is to pre-process.</li>

<li>\b topo_eps2 (real) - is the tolerance level between two CAD
patches. By default is equal to \f$\mathrm{diag} \times 10^{-4}\f$. This tolerance is used to
identify nodes to merge over different geometrical faces when
\b Topology option is to pre-process.</li>

<li>\b LSS (real) - is an abbreviation for "length of sub-segment". It is
a maximal allowed length of a mesh edge. Default is \f$0.5\f$.</li>

<li>\b frontal (integer)
<ul>
<li> 1 - the mesh generator inserts points with an advancing front method.</li>
<li> 0 - it inserts them with an algebraic method (on internal edges). This method is
slightly faster but generates less regular meshes. </li>
</ul>
Default is 0.</li>

\anchor blsurf_hinterpol_flag
<li>\b hinterpol_flag (integer) - determines the computation of an
interpolated value <i>v</i> between two points <i>P1</i> and <i>P2</i> on a
curve. Let <i>h1</i> be the value at point <i>P1,</i> <i>h2</i> be the value at point
<i>P2,</i> and <i>t</i> be a parameter varying from 0 to 1 when moving from <i>P1
to</i> <i>P2</i>.
<ul>
<li>0 - the interpolation is linear: \f$v = h1 + t (h2 - h1 )\f$</li>
<li>1 - the interpolation is geometric: \f$v = h1 \times \left( \frac{h1}{h2} \right)^{t}\f$</li>
<li>2 - the interpolation is sinusoidal: \f$v = \frac{h1+h2}{2} + \frac{h1-h2}{2 \cdot \cos(\pi \cdot t)}\f$</li>
</ul>
Default is 0.</li>

\anchor blsurf_hmean_flag

<li>1 - the geometric average is computed.</li>
</ul>
Default is 0.</li>

<li>\b CheckAdjacentEdges, \b CheckCloseEdges and \b CheckWellDefined
(integers) - gives the number of calls of equally named subroutines the
purpose of which is to improve the mesh of domains having narrow
parts. At each iteration,\b CheckCloseEdges decreases the sizes of the
edges when two boundary curves are neighboring,\b CheckAdjacentEdges
balances the sizes of adjacent edges, and \b CheckWellDefined checks if
the parametric domain is well defined. Default values are 0.</li>


<li>\b CoefRectangle (real)- defines the relative thickness of the rectangles
used by subroutine \b CheckCloseEdges (see above). Default is 0.25.</li>

<li>\b eps_collapse (real) - if more than 0.0, BLSURF removes
curves whose lengths are less than \b eps_collapse. To obtain an
approximate value of the length of a curve, it is arbitrarily
split into 20 edges. Default is 0.0.</li>

<li>\b eps_ends (real) - is used to detect the curves whose lengths are very
small, which sometimes constitutes an error. A message is printed
if \f$\left|P2-P1\right| < eps\_ends\f$, where <i>P1</i> and <i>P2</i> are the
extremities of a curve. Default is \f$\frac{\mathrm{diag}}{500.0}\f$.</li>

files. Default is 1.</li>
</ul>

\n
The following PreCAD options are commonly usable. 
<ul>
<li>\b closed_geometry (int) - describes whether the working geometry 
should be closed or not. When activated, this option helps PreCAD to process 
the dirtiest geometries. By default this option is 0.</li>
<li>\b debug (int) - If debug = 1 PreCAD will be very verbose and will output 
some intermediate files in the working directory. By default this
option is 0.</li>
<li>\b eps_nano_relative (real) -  the same as \b eps_nano, but relatively to 
the diagonal of the box bounding the geometry. By default this option is \f$10^{-5}\f$.</li>

the diagonal of the box bounding the geometry. By default this option is \f$5 \cdot 10^{-4}\f$.</li>
<li>\b manifold_geometry (int) - describes whether the working geometry should be manifold or not.
When activated, this option helps PreCAD to process the dirtiest
geometries. By default this option is 0.</li>
<li>\b create_tag_collision (int) - creates new tags from original ones in case 
of collision (entity merge or association for example). By default
this option is 0.</li>
<li>\b periodic_tolerance (real) - defines the maximum distance error accepted between 
two sets of periodic entities. By default this option is \f$\mathrm{diag} \times 10^{-5}\f$.</li>
<li>\b periodic_tolerance_relative (real) -  the same as \b
periodic_tolerance but in a relative unit. Bu default this option is \f$10^{-5}\f$.</li>
<li>\b periodic_split_tolerance (real) - This periodicity processing related option defines 
the minimum distance between a CAD point and an imprinted point. It allows to indirectly 
control the number of created points and small edges. By default this
option is \f$\mathrm{diag} \times 10^{-4}\f$.</li>
<li>\b periodic_split_tolerance_relative (real -  the same as \b
periodic_split_tolerance but in a relative unit. By default this
option is \f$10^{-4}\f$.</li>
</ul>

\anchor blsurf_local_size
<h1>Local size</h1>

Local sizes can be defined on faces, edges or vertices.
<ul>
<li>The faces, edges and vertices can belong to the meshed geometrical
object or to its sub-shapes (created using <b>Explode</b> command).</li>
<li>Groups of faces, edges and vertices are also handled.</li>
<li>It is possible to attribute the same size to several geometries using multi-selection.</li>
<li>The sizes are constant values or python functions.</li>
<li>In case of a python function, the following rules must be respected:
<ul>
<li>The name of the function is f.</li>
<li>If geometry is a face or a group of faces, the function is f(u,v).</li>
<li>If geometry is an edge or a group of edges, the function is f(t).</li>
<li>If geometry is a vertex or a group of vertices, the function is f().</li>
<li>The function must return a double.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

3 different types of size maps can be defined:
<ol>
<li type="a">\ref blsurf_sizemap_computation "Computation of the physical size"</li>
<li type="a">\ref blsurf_attractor "Advanced maps"</li>
<li type="a">\ref blsurf_attractor_computation "Computation of attractors"</li>
</ol>

\ref blsurf_top "Back to top"

\anchor blsurf_sizemap_computation
<h2>Computation of the physical size</h2>
\image html blsurf_parameters_sizemap1.png 

The physical size is obtained by querying sizemap functions associated to the input CAD object for surfaces, curves and points.
Each function can either return a value h (which is then trimmed
between the two bounds hphymin and hphymax), or "no answer" (by not
assigning a value to h), thus providing great flexibility in the
specification of the sizes. The computation depends on whether point P is internal to a surface, internal to a curve, or at the end of several curves:
<ul>
<li> If point P is internal to a surface, the CAD surface size function is queried. If no answer is returned, one interpolates with the values at the vertices of the discretized interface curves.</li>
<li> If point P is internal to a curve, the CAD curve size function is queried first. If no answer is returned, the surface size function is queried for every adjacent surface and the mean value of the returned values is computed. If no answer is returned, sizes h1 and h2 at both ends of the curve are considered (see next item) and the interpolated value is computed.</li>
<li> If point P is at the extremity of several curves, the CAD point size function is queried first. If no answer is returned, the curve size function is queried for every adjacent curve and the mean value of the returned values is computed. If no answer is returned, the surface size function is queried for every adjacent surface and the mean value of the returned values is computed. If there is still no answer returned, the default value hphydef is kept.</li>
</ul>
In order to compute the mean of several values, the arithmetic mean is used by default, but this can be modified by the parameter \ref blsurf_hmean_flag "hmean flag". In the same way, in order to interpolate two values, a linear interpolation is used by default, but this can be modified by \ref blsurf_hinterpol_flag "hinterpol flag".

\anchor blsurf_attractor
<h2>Advanced maps</h2>
\n
\image html blsurf_parameters_sizemap2.png 
\n
More specific size maps can be defined on faces. 

<ul>
<li> <i> Attractors </i> allow to define the size of the mesh elements
on a face so that the mesh is the finest on the attractor shape and
becomes coarser when getting far from this shape.
<ul> 
<li> The selected attractor can be a Vertex, an Edge, a Wire or a
Compound mixing several entities of those types.</li>
<li> The attractor doesn't have to be a sub-shape of the shape to mesh.</li>
<li> The size will grow exponentially (see the formula below) but is
bounded by gradation, \n so if you want the formula to be strictly
respected, you should set the <i>gradation</i> 
to its maximum (2.5) in the <i>arguments</i> tab. 
</ul>
\n
<li> Furthermore you can choose to <i> keep the size constant </i>
until a certain distance from a shape. This option can be combined or
not with an <i>attractor</i> size map described above. 
<ul>
<li> If the two options are combined the size will remain constant
until the distance specified in "constant over" and grow then as
prescribed by the attractor function.</li>
<li> Else the growing is only controled by the standard arguments of
BLSURF (gradation ...).</li>
</ul>
</ul>

\image html blsurf_const_size_near_shape2.png "Example of size map with constant size option, the size is kept constant on the left side of the surface until a certain distance"

Remark : The validation of the hypothesis might take a few seconds if
attractors are defined or the "constant size" option is used because a
map of distances has to be built on the whole surface for each face
where such a hypothesis has been defined.

\anchor blsurf_attractor_computation
<h2>Computation of attractors</h2>
\n
The size grows exponentially following the equation : 
\f$h(d) = \mathrm{User Size} + (\mathrm{h\_start} - \mathrm{User Size}) \times e ^ { - \left( \frac{d}{R} \right) ^ {2} }\f$
\n
Where :
<ul>
<li>h_start is the desired size on the given attractor shape</li>
<li>d is the distance of the current point from the attractor
shape. The distance is the geodesic distance (i.e. calculated by following the surface to be meshed) </li>
<li>R is called the distance of influence and allows controlling the growth rate of the mesh </li>
</ul>

\anchor blsurf_enforced_elements
<h1>Enforced vertices</h1>

\image html blsurf_parameters_enforced_vertices.png

It is possible to define some enforced vertices to BLSurf algorithm.
An enforced vertex is defined on a Face or a Compound by
<ul>
<li> selecting an existing Vertex or Compound,</li>
<li> or creating a new vertex given its coordinates.</li>
</ul>
The enforced vertex is the projection of a point defined by its
(x,y,z) coordinates on the selected face.
<ul>
<li>It is possible to define several enforced vertices on a face or a group of faces.</li>
<li>If the projected point is on the boundary or outside of the face, it will be ignored.</li>
<li>If a group name is specified, the enforced nodes will be added in the group. If the group does not exist it will be created.
</ul>

\anchor blsurf_limitations
<h1>Limitations</h1>

Currently BLSURF plugin has the following limitations.
<ul>
  <li>BLSURF algorithm cannot be used as a local algorithm (on
      sub-meshes) or as a provider of a low-level
      mesh for some 3D algorithms, because the BLSURF mesher (and
      consequently plugin) does not provide the information on node
      parameters on edges (U) and faces (U,V). For example the
      following combinations of algorithms are impossible:
      <ul>
        <li> global MEFISTO or Quadrangle(mapping) + local BLSURF;</li>
        <li> BLSURF + Projection 2D from faces meshed by BLSURF;</li>
        <li> local BLSURF + Extrusion 3D;</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
