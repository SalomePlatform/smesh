\n This algorithm applies to the meshing of 2D shapes under the
following conditions: the face must be a full circle or a part of circle
(i.e. the number of edges is less or equal to 3 and one of them is a circle curve).
The resulting mesh consists of triangles (near the center point) and
quadrangles.

This algorithm is optionally parametrized by the hypothesis indicating the number
of mesh layers along the radius. The distribution of layers can be set with any 1D Hypothesis.

If no own hypothesis of the algorithm is assigned, any local or global hypothesis is used 
by the algorithm to discretize edges. Note that if the geometrical face has two radial edges,
they must be meshed with equal number of segments.

If no 1D hypothesis is assigned to an edge, "Default Number of Segments" preferences parameter
is used to discretize the edge.
