\n This algorithm applies to the meshing of a 2D shapes.
Required conditions: Face must be a full circle or part of circle
(i.e. number of edges <= 3 and one of them must be a circle curve).
The resulting mesh consists of triangles (near center point) and
quadrangles.

This algorithm also requires the information concerning the number and
distribution of mesh layers alond a radius of circle. Distribution of
layers can be set with any of 1D Hypotheses.
