\page quad_from_ma_algo_page Medial Axis Projection Quadrangle meshing algorithm

Medial Axis Projection algorithm can be used for meshing faces with
sinuous borders and having channel-like shape, for which is it
difficult to define 1D hypotheses so that generated quadrangles to be
of good shape.

The algorithm assures good shape of quadrangles by constructing Medial
Axis between sinuous borders of the face and using it to
discretize the borders.

The Medial Axis is used in two ways:
<ol>
<li>If there is a sub-mesh on either sinuous border, then the nodes of
  this border are mapped to the opposite border via the Medial
  Axis.</li>
<li> If there is no sub-meshes on the sinuous borders, then a part of
  the Medial Axis that can be mapped to both borders is discretized
  using a hypothesis assigned to the face or its ancestor shapes,
  and the division points are mapped from the Medial Axis to the both
  borders.</li>
</ol>
