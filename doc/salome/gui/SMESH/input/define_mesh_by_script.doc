\page  use_existing_page Use Edges/Faces to be Created Manually

The algorithms <b>Use Edges to be Created Manually</b> and 
<b>Use Faces to be Created Manually</b> allow  creating a 1D or a 2D mesh
in a python script (using <em>AddNode, AddEdge</em>
and <em>AddFace</em> commands) and then using such sub-meshes in the
construction of a 2D or a 3D mesh. 

For example, you want to use standard algorithms to generate 1D and 3D
meshes and to create 2D mesh by your python code. For this, you
<ol>
  <li> create a mesh object, assign a 1D algorithm,</li>
  <li> invoke \b Compute command, which computes a 1D mesh,</li>
  <li> assign <b>Use Faces to be Created Manually</b> and a 3D algorithm,</li>
  <li> run your python code, which creates a 2D mesh,</li>
  <li> invoke \b Compute command, which computes a 3D mesh.</li>
</ol>

\warning <b>Use Edges to be Created Manually</b> and <b>Use Faces to
be Created Manually</b> algorithms should be assigned _before_
mesh generation by the Python code.

Consider trying a sample script demonstrating the usage of 
\ref tui_use_existing_faces "Use Faces to be Created Manually"
algorithm for construction of a 2D mesh using Python commands.
