\n <b>Netgen 2D</b> and <b>Netgen 3D</b> hypotheses work only with <b>Netgen 1D-2D</b> and
<b>Netgen 1D-2D-3D</b> algorithms. These algorithms do not require
definition of lower-level  hypotheses and algorithms (2D and 1D for
meshing 3D objects and 1D for meshing 2D objects). They prove to be
useful if lower-level meshing is homogeneous for all wires and faces
of the meshed object.

<ul>
<li><b>Name</b> - allows to define the name for the algorithm (Netgen
2D (or 3D) Parameters by default).</li>
<li><b>Max Size</b> - maximum linear dimensions for mesh cells.</li>
<li><b>Second Order</b> - if this box is checked in, the algorithm will
create second order nodes on the mesh, which actually will become
\ref adding_quadratic_elements_page "Quadratic".</li>
<li><b>Fineness</b> - ranging from Very Coarse to Very Fine allows to set the
level of meshing detalization using the three parameters below. You
can select Custom to define them manually.</li>
<li><b>Growth rate</b> - allows to define how much the linear dimensions of
two adjacent cells can differ (i.e. 0.3 means 30%).</li>
<li><b>Nb. Segs per Edge</b> and <b>Nb Segs per Radius</b> - allows to define the
minimum number of mesh segments in which edges and radiuses will be
split.</li>
<li><b>Allow Quadrangles</b> - allows to use quadrangle elements in a
triangle 2D mesh. This checkbox is not present in Netgen 3D parameters
because currently building a tetrahedral mesh with quadrangle faces is
not possible.</li>
<li><b>Optimize</b> - if this box is checked in, the algorithm will try to
create regular (possessing even sides) elements.</li>
</ul>
