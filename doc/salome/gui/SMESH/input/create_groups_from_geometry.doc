\page create_groups_from_geometry_page Create Groups from Geometry

This operation allows creating groups on geometry on all selected
shapes. Only the main shape of the mesh and its sub-shapes can be selected.

The type of each new group is defined automatically by the nature of
the <b>Geometry</b>.
The group names will be the same as the names of geometrical objects.

\warning It's impossible to create a group of <em>0D elements</em> or <em>ball
elements</em> with this operation. For this, it is necessary to use 
\ref creating_groups_page "Create Group" operation. 

To use this operation, select in the \b Mesh menu or in the contextual
menu in the Object browser <b>Create Groups from Geometry</b> item.
