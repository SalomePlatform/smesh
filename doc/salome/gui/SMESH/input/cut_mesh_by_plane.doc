\page cut_mesh_by_plane_page Cut a tetrahedron mesh by a plane

\n MeshCut works only with MED files and produces MED files, and is a standalone program.
It can be used either directly from a command shell outside SALOME, or with a GUI interface in SMESH,
provided in a python plugin that needs to be installed in your SALOME application.

\n MeshCut allows to cut a mesh constituted of linear tetrahedrons by a plane.
\n The tetrahedrons intersected by the plane are cut and replaced by elements of various types,
(tetrahedron, pyramid, pentahedron).

<h2>Using MeshCut as a standalone program, outside SALOME</h2>

\n MeshCut is a standalone program, reading and producing med files.                
\n                 
\n Syntax:
\code
MeshCut input.med output.med resuMeshName aboveGroup belowGroup nx ny nz px py pz T
\endcode

\n                 
\n where:
\n  input.med    = name of the original mesh file in med format
\n  output.med   = name of the result mesh file in med format
\n  resuMeshName = name of the result mesh
\n  aboveGroup   = name of the group of volumes above the cut plane
\n  belowGroups  = name of the group of volumes below the cut plane
\n  nx ny nz     = vector normal to the cut plane
\n  px py pz     = a point of the cut plane
\n  T            = 0 < T < 1 : vertices of a tetrahedron are considered as belonging to
\n                 the cut plane if their distance from the plane is inferior to L*T,
\n                 where L is the mean edge size of the tetrahedron

<h2>Using MeshCut inside SALOME</h2>

When the MeshCut plugin is installed, it can be found in the Mesh menu, sub-menu SMESH_plugins.
\n If the plugin is not installed, the file meshcut_plugin.py is in
SMESH installation in  subdirectory bin/salome/meshcut_plugin.py.

\n If there are already plugins defined in a smesh_plugins.py file,
 this file should be added at the end.
 if not, copied as ${HOME}/Plugins/smesh_plugins.py or ${APPLI}/Plugins/smesh_plugins.py
 or in ${PLUGINPATH} Directory.
 
From the Mesh menu, sub-menu SMESH_plugins, choose "MeshCut" item
The following dialog box will appear:

See above for the meaning of the parameters.
