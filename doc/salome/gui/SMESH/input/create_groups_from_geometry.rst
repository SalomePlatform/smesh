Create Groups from Geometry
***************************

This operation allows creating groups on geometry on all selected shapes. Only the main shape of the mesh and its sub-shapes can be selected.

The type of each new group is defined automatically by the nature of the **Geometry**.
The group names will be the same as the names of geometrical objects.

To use this operation, select in the **Mesh** menu or in the contextual menu in the Object browser **Create Groups from Geometry** item.
