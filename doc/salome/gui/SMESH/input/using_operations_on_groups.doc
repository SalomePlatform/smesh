\page using_operations_on_groups_page Boolean operations on groups

\n In MESH you can perform some Boolean operations on groups, which
belong to one and the same mesh.
<ul>
<li>\ref union_anchor "Union"</li>
<li>\ref intersection_anchor "Intersection"</li>
<li>\ref cut_anchor "Cut"</li>
</ul>


<br>
\anchor union_anchor
<h2>Union of groups</h2>

This operation allows to create a new group in such a way that all
mesh elements that are present in the initial groups will be added to
the new one.

<em>To union groups:</em>
<ol>
<li>In the \b Mesh menu select the <b>Union Groups</b> item. The following
dialog box will appear:

\image html uniongroups.png

In this dialog box you should specify the name of the resulting group
and set of groups which will be united.

For example, we have two groups Group1 and Group2. 
\n The result of their \b Union will be Group12:

\image html image133.gif
<center>Group1</center>

\image html image134.gif
<center>Group2</center>

\image html image135.gif
<center>Group12</center>
</li>
<li>Click the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button to confirm creation of the group.</li>
</ol>

<b>See Also</b> a sample TUI Script of a 
\ref tui_union_of_groups "Union of Groups" operation.

<br>
\anchor intersection_anchor
<h2>Intersection of groups</h2>

This operation allows to create a new group in such a way that all
mesh elements that are present in all initial groups together are added to the
new one.

<em>To intersect groups:</em>
<ol>
<li>In the \b Mesh menu select the <b>Intersect Groups</b> item. The
following dialog box will appear:

\image html intersectgroups.png

In this dialog box you should specify the name of the resulting group
and set of groups which will be intersected.

For example, we have two groups Group1 and Group2. 
\n The result of their \b Intersection will be Group12a:

\image html image133.gif
<center>Group1</center>

\image html image134.gif
<center>Group2</center>

\image html image136.gif
<center>Group12a</center>
</li>
<li>Click the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button to confirm creation of the group.</li>
</ol>

<b>See Also</b> a sample TUI Script of an  
\ref tui_intersection_of_groups "Intersection of Groups" operation.  

<br>
\anchor cut_anchor
<h2>Cut of groups</h2>

This operation allows to create a new group in such a way that all
mesh elements that are present in the main groups but are absent in the
tool groups are added to the new one.

<em>To cut groups:</em>
<ol>
<li>In the \b Mesh menu select the <b>Cut Groups</b> item. The
following dialog box will appear:

\image html cutgroups.png

In this dialog box you should specify the name of the resulting group
and groups which will be cut.

For example, we have two groups Group1 and Group2. 
\n The result of their \b Cut will be Group12b:

\image html image133.gif
<center>Group1</center>

\image html image134.gif
<center>Group2</center>

\image html image137.gif
<center>Group12b</center>
</li>
<li>Click the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button to confirm creation of the
group.</li>
</ol>

\ref tui_cut_of_groups "Cut of Groups" operation.
