\page ghs3d_hypo_page GHS3D Parameters hypothesis

\n GHS3D Parameters hypothesis works only with <b>Tetrahedron (GHS3D)</b> 
algorithm. This algorithm is a commercial software.

<ul>
<li><b>Name</b> - allows to define the name of the hypothesis (GHS3D 
Parameters by default).</li>

<li><b>To mesh holes</b> - if this box is checked, the algorithm will 
create mesh also in holes inside a solid shape, else only the outermost
shape will be meshed.</li>

<li><b>Optimization level</b> - sets the desired optimization level.
Optimization levels are: none, light, medium, strong, in increasing 
order of "quality vs speed" ratio.
</li>

<li><b>Maximum memory size</b> - launches ghs3d software with
work space limited to specified Megabytes of memory. If this option is
checked off, the software will be launched with 0.7 * total RAM space. </li>

<li><b>Initial memory size</b> - starts ghs3d software with
specified Megabytes of work space. If this option is checked off, the
software will be started with 100 Megabytes of working space. </li>

<li><b>Working directory</b> - defines folder for input and output
files of ghs3d software, which are files starting with "GHS3D_" prefix. </li>

<li><b>Keep working files</b> - allows to check input and output files
of ghs3d software, while usually these files are removed after mesher launch </li>

</ul>
