\page ghs3d_hypo_page GHS3D Parameters hypothesis

\n GHS3D Parameters hypothesis works only with <b>Tetrahedron (GHS3D)</b> 
algorithm. This algorithm is a commercial software.

<ul>
<li><b>Name</b> - allows to define the name of the hypothesis (GHS3D 
Parameters by default).</li>

<li><b>To mesh holes</b> - if this box is checked, the algorithm will 
create mesh also in holes inside a solid shape, else only the outermost
shape will be meshed. Volumic elements created within holes are bound
to the solid.</li>

<li><b>Optimization level</b> - sets the desired optimization level.
Optimization levels are: none, light, medium, strong, in increasing 
order of "quality vs speed" ratio.
</li>

<li><b>Maximum memory size</b> - launches ghs3d software with
work space limited to specified Megabytes of memory. If this option is
checked off, the software will be launched with 0.7 * total RAM space. </li>

<li><b>Initial memory size</b> - starts ghs3d software with
specified Megabytes of work space. If this option is checked off, the
software will be started with 100 Megabytes of working space. </li>

<li><b>Working directory</b> - defines folder for input and output
files of ghs3d software, which are files starting with "GHS3D_" prefix. </li>

<li><b>Keep working files</b> - allows to check input and output files
of ghs3d software, while usually these files are removed after mesher launch.</li>

<li><b>Verbose level</b> - to choose verbosity level in the range 0 to 10.
<ul> <li>0, no standard output,
</li><li>2, prints the data, quality statistics of the skin and final
meshes and indicates when the final mesh is being saved. In addition
the software gives indication regarding the CPU time.
</li><li>10, same as 2 plus the main steps in the computation, quality
statistics histogram of the skin mesh, quality statistics histogram
together with the characteristics of the final mesh.
</li></ul></li>

<li><b>To create new nodes</b> - if this option is checked off, ghs3d
tries to create tetrahedrons using only nodes of 2D mesh.</li>

<li><b>To use boundary recovery version</b> - enables using a
boundary recovery module which tries to
create volume meshes starting from very poor quality surface meshes
(almost flat triangles on the surface, high density propagation,
extreme aspect ratios, etc.) which fails with the standard version. The
resulting volume mesh will however most likely have a very poor
quality (poor aspect ratio of elements, tetrahedra with a very small
positive volume).</li>

<li><b>Option as text</b> - allows entering any text that will be
used as command line option of ghs3d. This is for giving
advanced options in a free from. </li>

</ul>
