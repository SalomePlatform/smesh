\page adding_nodes_and_elements_page Adding nodes and elements

\n In MESH you can add to your mesh different elements such as:

<ul>
<li>\ref adding_nodes_anchor "Nodes"</li>
<li>\ref adding_0delems_anchor "0D Elements"</li>
<li>\ref adding_0delems_on_all_nodes_anchor "0D elements on Element Nodes"</li>
<li>\ref adding_balls_anchor "Ball Elements"</li>
<li>\ref adding_edges_anchor "Edges"</li>
<li>\ref adding_triangles_anchor "Triangles"</li>
<li>\ref adding_quadrangles_anchor "Quadrangles"</li>
<li>\ref adding_polygons_anchor "Polygons"</li>
<li>\ref adding_tetrahedrons_anchor "Tetrahedrons"</li>
<li>\ref adding_hexahedrons_anchor "Hexahedrons"</li>
<li>\ref adding_octahedrons_anchor "Hexagonal prism"</li>
<li>\ref adding_polyhedrons_anchor "Polyhedrons"</li>
</ul>

The convention of nodal connectivity of elements used in SALOME is
the MED library convention. You can consult the description of
nodal connectivity of elements in the documentation on MED library or 
\ref connectivity_page "here".

<em>To add a node or an element to your mesh:</em>
<ol>
  <li>Select your mesh in the Object Browser or in the 3D viewer.</li>

  <li>From the \b Modification menu choose the \b Add item, the
    following associated sub-menu will appear:</li>

  \image html image152.png

From this sub-menu select the type of element which you would like to add to your mesh.

\note All dialogs for new node or element adding to the mesh provide
the possibility to automatically add
a node or element to the specified group or to create it anew using
<b>Add to group</b> box, that allows choosing an existing group for
the created node or element or giving the name to a new group. By
default, the <b>Add to group</b> check box is switched off. If the user
switches this check box on, the combo box listing all currently
existing groups of the corresponding type becomes available. By
default, no group is selected. In this case, when the user presses
<b>Apply</b> or <b>Apply & Close</b> button, the warning message box
informs the user about the necessity to input new group name. The
combo box lists groups of all the 
\ref grouping_elements_page "three types": both 
\ref standalone_group "standalone groups",
\ref group_on_filter "groups on filter", and 
\ref group_on_geom "groups on geometry". If the user chooses a
group on geometry or on filter, he is warned and proposed to
convert this group to standalone.
If the user rejects conversion operation, it is cancelled and
a new node/element is not created!

</ol>

\anchor adding_nodes_anchor
<h2>Adding nodes</h2>

\image html addnode.png

In this dialog box set coordinates for your node in the \b Coordinates
set of fields and click the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button. Your node will be
created:

\image html add_node.png

<br>
\anchor adding_0delems_anchor
<h2>Adding 0D elements</h2>

\image html add0delement.png

In this dialog box specify nodes which will form your 0D elements by
selecting them in the 3D viewer. Activate <b>Allow duplicate
  elements</b> to get several 0D elements on a node. Click the \b Apply or
<b>Apply and Close</b> button. Your 0D elements will be created:

\image html add_0delement.png

\anchor adding_0delems_on_all_nodes_anchor
<h2>Making 0D elements on Element Nodes</h2>

There is another way to create 0D elements. It is possible to create
0D elements on all nodes of the selected mesh, sub-mesh, or a group of elements or nodes.

\image html dlg_0D_on_all_nodes.png

In this dialog
<ul>
  <li> The radio-buttons allow choosing the type of object to create 0D elements on.
    <ul>
      <li><b> Mesh, sub-mesh, group </b> - this button allows selecting
        a mesh, a sub-mesh or a group to create 0D elements on the nodes of its
        elements. The name of the selected object is shown in the dialog. </li>
      <li><b> Elements </b> - this button allows selecting elements in the
        VTK viewer or typing their IDs in the dialog.</li>
      <li><b> Nodes </b> - this button allows selecting nodes to create
        0D elements on in the VTK viewer or typing their IDs in the dialog.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><b> Set Filter </b> button allows selecting elements or nodes
    by filtering mesh elements or nodes with different criteria
    (see \ref filtering_elements "Filter usage").</li>
  <li>Activate <b>Allow duplicate elements</b> to get several 0D
    elements on a node. </li>
  <li> Switching on <b>Add to group</b> check-box allows specifying the
    name of the group to which all created or found (existing) 0D elements will
    be added. You can either select an existing group from a drop-down
    list, or enter the name of the group to be created. If a selected
    existing \ref grouping_elements_page "group" is not Standalone
    (Group On Geometry or Group On Filter) it will be converted to
    Standalone.
    \warning If <b>Add to group</b> is activated it has to be filled in.
</li>
</ul>


\anchor adding_balls_anchor
<h2>Adding ball elements</h2>

\image html addball.png

In this dialog box specify the nodes, which will form your ball elements,
either by selecting them in the 3D viewer or by manually entering their IDs,
specify the ball diameter and click the \b Apply or <b>Apply and
  Close</b> button.

\image html add_ball.png

<br>
\anchor adding_edges_anchor
<h2>Adding edges</h2>

\image html addedge.png

In this dialog box specify the nodes which will form your edge by
selecting them in the 3D viewer with pressed Shift button and click
the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button. Your edge will be created:

\image html add_edge.png

<br>
\anchor adding_triangles_anchor
<h2>Adding triangles</h2>

\image html addtriangle.png

In this dialog box specify the nodes which will form your triangle by
selecting them in the 3D viewer with pressed Shift button and click
the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button. Your triangle will be created:

\image html add_triangle.png

<br>
\anchor adding_quadrangles_anchor
<h2>Adding quadrangles</h2>

\image html addquadrangle.png

In this dialog box specify the nodes which will form your quadrangle
by selecting them in the 3D viewer with pressed Shift button and click
the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button. Your quadrangle will be created:

\image html add_quadrangle.png

<br>
\anchor adding_polygons_anchor
<h2>Adding polygons</h2>

\image html addpolygon.png

In this dialog box specify the nodes which will form your polygon by
selecting them in the 3D viewer with pressed Shift button and click
the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button.

\image html add_polygone.png

<br>
\anchor adding_tetrahedrons_anchor
<h2>Adding tetrahedrons</h2>

\image html addtetrahedron.png

In this dialog box specify the nodes which will form your tetrahedron
by selecting them in the 3D viewer with pressed Shift button and click
the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button. Your tetrahedron will be created:

\image html image70.jpg

<br>
\anchor adding_hexahedrons_anchor
<h2>Adding hexahedrons</h2>

\image html addhexahedron.png

In this dialog box specify the nodes which will form your hexahedron
by selecting them in the 3D viewer with pressed Shift button and click
the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button. Your hexahedron will be created:

\image html image71.jpg

<br>
\anchor adding_octahedrons_anchor
<h2>Adding hexagonal prism</h2>

In the Add Hexagonal Prism dialog box specify the nodes which will
form your hexagonal prism by selecting them in the 3D viewer with pressed Shift button and click
the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button. Your hexagonal prism will be created:

\image html image_octa12.png

<br>
\anchor adding_polyhedrons_anchor
<h2>Adding polyhedrons</h2>

\image html a-createpolyhedralvolume.png

There are two different ways to add polyhedral volumes. 
\n If you select \b Node as <b>Elements Type</b> you will specify the
nodes which will form the faces of your polyhedron by selecting the
nodes in the 3D viewer with pressed Shift button and clicking the \b
Add button to add the face in the list of Faces by Nodes, which will
form your polyhedron. Note, that it could be very useful to toggle
Polyhedron Preview checkbox to see the results of your selection.
\n The second way is somewhat simpler, however, there are cases when
it does not provide you with the necessary level of precision. If you
select \b Face as <b>Elements Type</b>, you will be able to select the faces
which will form your polyhedron in the 3D viewer with pressed Shift
button. If you've managed to obtain the necessary result, click the
\b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button. Your polyhedron will be created:
