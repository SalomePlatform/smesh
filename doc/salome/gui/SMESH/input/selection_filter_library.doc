\n Selection filter library is a powerful tool enabling to create
filters to be used on meshes. You can access to it from the Main Menu
via <b>Tools / Selection filter library</b>.

<b>Library file name</b> shows the path and the file name where your
filters will be stored. By clicking the <em>Browse</em> button you can load an
existing filter library.
\n <b>Names of filters</b> lists the filters created or uploaded for
the current study. You can \b Add or \b Delete filters.
\n In <b>Filter name</b> box you can specify the name for your
filter. By default it is prefixed with the corresponding entity type.
\n Each filter can be applicable to \b Nodes, \b Edges, \b Faces or \b
Volumes. You can combine many criteria in one filter, but they all
must be of the same <b>Entity type</b>.
\n The \b Add button creates a new criterion at the end of the list of
criteria. The \b Insert button creates a new criterion before the
selected criterion. The \b Remove button deletes the selected
criterion. The \b Clear button deletes all criteria.
\n Each <b>Entity type</b> has its specific list of criteria, however all
filters have common syntax. For each criterion you should specify the
<b>Threshold Value</b> and whether we search for the elements that should be
\b More, \b Less or \b Equal to this \b Value. You should also specify if the
criterion is \b Unary or \b Binary.   
\n Some criteria should have the additional parameter of \b Tolerance.

When we create a <b>Standalone Group</b> using filters (for this click
<b>Set Filters</b> button in the <b>Create Group</b> menu), the menu
for setting filters looks a bit differently. Toggling <b>Insert filter
in viewer</b> checkbox enables to preview the group selected with your
current filter in the viewer.
\n In the \b Source field you choose if the filter will be applied to
the whole \b Mesh, the <b>Initial Selection</b> or the <b>Current Group</b>. 
\n <b>Copy from...</b> button gives you a possibility to load an
existing filter from <b>Selection filter library</b> and <b>Add
to...</b> button gives you a possibility to save your current filter
in the Library.
