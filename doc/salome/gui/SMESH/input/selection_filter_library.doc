\page selection_filter_library_page Selection filter library

\n Selection filter library is a powerful tool enabling to create
filters to be used on meshes. You can access to it from the Main Menu
via <b>Tools / Selection filter library</b>.

\image html selectionfilterlibrary.png

<b>Library file name</b> shows the path and the file name where your
filters will be stored. By clicking the <em>Browse</em> button you can
load an existing filter library.
\n <b>Names of filters</b> lists the filters created or uploaded for
the current study. You can \b Add or \b Delete filters.
\n In <b>Filter name</b> box you can specify the name for your
filter. By default it is prefixed with the corresponding entity type.

\anchor filtering_elements

When we use filters during a group creation or another operation (by 
clicking <b>Set Filters</b> button in the corresponding dialog), the
menu for setting filters looks a bit differently (see the image below).

Each filter can be applicable to \b Nodes, \b Edges, \b Faces or \b
Volumes. You can combine many criteria in one filter, but they all
must be of the same <b>Entity type</b>.
\n The \b Add button creates a new criterion at the end of the list of
criteria. The \b Insert button creates a new criterion before the
selected criterion. The \b Remove button deletes the selected
criterion. The \b Clear button deletes all criteria.
\n Each <b>Entity type</b> has its specific list of criteria, however all
filters have common syntax. For each criterion you should specify the
<b>Threshold Value</b> and whether we search for the elements that should be
\b More, \b Less or \b Equal to this \b Value. You can also reverse the
sense of a criterion using \b Unary operator Not and you should
specify logical relations between criteria using \b Binary operators
Or and And.
\n Some criteria should have the additional parameter of \b Tolerance.
<br> 
Switching on <b>Insert filter in viewer</b> checkbox limits
selection of elements in the Viewer to the current filter.
<br>
In the \b Source field you choose if the filter will be applied to
the whole \b Mesh, the <b>Initial Selection</b> or the <b>Current
Group</b>. If \b Mesh is chosen, the elements satisfying the filter
will be selected in the 3D Viewer. If <b> Initial Selection</b> is
chosen, the filter will be applied to the selected elements and the
elements rejected by the filter will be deselected. If <b>Current
Group</b> is chosen, the filter will be applied to the list of
elements in the current dialog and the elements rejected
by the filter will be removed from the list.
<br>
<b>Copy from...</b> button gives you a possibility to load an
existing filter from <b>Selection filter library</b> and <b>Add
to...</b> button gives you a possibility to save your current filter
in the Library.
<br>
<b>Note:</b> If the button <b>Apply and Close</b> is disabled, there
is no selected mesh in the Object Browser and the filter can not be
created. You have to select the mesh and the button will be enabled.

Some criteria are applicable to all <b>Entity types</b>:
<ul><li>
<b>Belong to Geom</b> selects entities whose all nodes
lie on the shape defined by <b>Threshold Value</b>.
If the threshold shape is a sub-shape of the main shape of the mesh
the algorithm works faster, if this is any other
shape the algorithm works slower.
</li><li>
<b>Lying on Geom</b> selects entities whose at least one node
lies on the shape defined by the <b>Threshold Value</b>.
If the threshold shape is a sub-shape of the main shape of the mesh the
algorithm works faster, if this is any other
shape, the algorithm works slower.
</li><li>
<b>Range of IDs</b> allows selection of entities with the specified
IDs. 
<b>Threshold Value</b> can be, for example: "1,2,3,50-60,63,67,70-78"
