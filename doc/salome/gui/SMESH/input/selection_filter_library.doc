\page selection_filter_library_page Selection filter library

\n Selection filter library allows creating and storing in files
the filters that can be later reused for operations on meshes. You can
access it from the Main Menu via <b>Tools / Selection filter library</b>.
It is also possible to save/load a filter by invoking the filter library
from \ref filtering_elements "Filter dialog" launched from any mesh operation.

<b>Library file name</b> shows the path and the file name where your
filters will be stored. By clicking the <em>Browse</em> button you can
load an existing filter library.
\n <b>Names of filters</b> lists the filters created or uploaded for
the current study. You can \b Add or \b Delete filters.
\n In <b>Filter name</b> box you can specify the name for your
filter. By default it is prefixed with the corresponding entity type.

<h2>Filter Dialog</h2>

When we use filters during group creation or another operation (by 
clicking <b>Set Filter</b> button in the corresponding dialog), the
dialog for setting filters looks as shown below.

\image html a-filteronfaces.png

The \b Add button creates a new criterion at the end of the list of
criteria. The \b Insert button creates a new criterion before the
selected criterion. The \b Remove button deletes the selected
criterion. The \b Clear button deletes all criteria.\n
If there is a choice of <b>Entity type</b> in the dialog, only
criteria of currently selected type are used to create or change a
filter, and criteria of hidden types (if were specified) are ignored.
\n Each <b>Entity type</b> has its specific list of criteria, however all
filters have common syntax. The <b>Threshold Value</b> should be specified 
for most criteria. For numerical criteria it is necessary to indicate if 
the found elements should be \b More, \b Less or \b Equal to this
\b Value. You can also reverse the sense of a criterion using \b Unary
operator \a Not and you should specify logical relations between
criteria using \b Binary operators \a Or and \a And.
\n Some criteria have the additional parameter of \b Tolerance.<br> 
Switching on <b>Insert filter in viewer</b> check-box limits
selection of elements in the Viewer to the current filter.
<br>
In the \b Source field you choose if the filter will be applied to
the whole \b Mesh, the <b>Initial Selection</b> or the <b>Current
Dialog</b>. If \b Mesh is chosen, the elements satisfying the filter
will be selected in the 3D Viewer. If <b> Initial Selection</b> is
chosen, the filter will be applied to the selected elements and the
elements rejected by the filter will be deselected. If <b>Current
Dialog</b> is chosen, the filter will be applied to the list of
elements in the current dialog and the elements rejected
by the filter will be removed from the list.
<br>
<b>Copy from...</b> button gives you a possibility to load an
existing filter from <b>Selection filter library</b> and <b>Add
to...</b> button gives you a possibility to save your current filter
in the Library.
<br>
<b>Note:</b> If the button <b>Apply and Close</b> is disabled, there
is no selected mesh in the Object Browser and the filter can not be
created. You have to select the mesh and the button will be enabled.

Some criteria are applicable to all <b>Entity types</b>:
<ul><li>
<b>Belong to Geom</b> selects entities whose all nodes lie on the
shape defined by <b>Threshold Value</b>. 
If the threshold shape is a sub-shape of the main shape of the mesh,
the filtering algorithm works faster because node-to-shape association
is used instead of measuring distance between nodes and the shape, and
\b Tolerance is not used. If the threshold shape is any other shape,
the algorithm works slower because distance between nodes and the
shape is measured and is compared with \b Tolerance. The latter
approach (distance measurement) is also used if an element is not
associated to any shape.
</li><li>
<b>Lying on Geom</b> selects entities whose at least one node
lies on the shape defined by the <b>Threshold Value</b>.
If the threshold shape is a sub-shape of the main shape of the mesh,
the filtering algorithm works faster because node-to-shape association
is used instead of measuring distance between nodes and the shape, and
\b Tolerance is not used. If the threshold shape is any other shape,
the algorithm works slower because distance between nodes and the
shape is measured and is compared with \b Tolerance. The latter
approach (distance measurement) is also used if an element is not
associated to any shape.
</li><li>
<b>Belong to Mesh Group</b> selects entities included into the mesh group
defined by the <b>Threshold Value</b>.
</li><li>
<b>Range of IDs</b> allows selection of entities with the specified
IDs. 
<b>Threshold Value</b> can be, for example: "1,2,3,50-60,63,67,70-78"
</li><li>
<b>Color of Group</b> allows selection of entities belonging to the Group with
the color defined by the <b>Threshold Value</b>.
</li><li>
<b>Elements of a domain</b> allows selection of entities belonging to
one domain of a mesh. The domain is mesh part not connected to
other parts. <b>Threshold Value</b> locating any element of the domain can be either
- node ID (that you can pick in the Viewer) or
- geometrical vertex (that you can pick either in the Viewer or in the
  Object Browser) or
- 3 coordinates of a point (that you can enter in TUI mode only).

</li>
</ul>

Some criteria are applicable to entities of dimension
more than zero, i.e. to \b Edges, \b Faces and \b Volumes:
<ul><li>
<b>Linear</b> allows selection of Linear or Quadratic elements (if Unary is set to "Not")
</li><li>
<b>Geometry type</b> allows selection of elements by their geometric type
defined by the <b>Threshold Value</b>. The list of available geometric
types depends on the current entity type.
</li><li>

as a combination of geometry type and the number of nodes.
</li>
</ul>
