\page selection_filter_library_page Selection filter library

\n Selection filter library is a powerful tool enabling to create
filters to be used on meshes. You can access to it from the Main Menu
via <b>Tools / Selection filter library</b>.

<b>Library file name</b> shows the path and the file name where your
filters will be stored. By clicking the <em>Browse</em> button you can load an
existing filter library.
\n <b>Names of filters</b> lists the filters created or uploaded for
the current study. You can \b Add or \b Delete filters.
\n In <b>Filter name</b> box you can specify the name for your
filter. By default it is prefixed with the corresponding entity type.
\n Each filter can be applicable to \b Nodes, \b Edges, \b Faces or \b
Volumes. You can combine many criteria in one filter, but they all
must be of the same <b>Entity type</b>.
\n The \b Add button creates a new criterion at the end of the list of
criteria. The \b Insert button creates a new criterion before the
selected criterion. The \b Remove button deletes the selected
criterion. The \b Clear button deletes all criteria.
\n Each <b>Entity type</b> has its specific list of criteria, however all
filters have common syntax. For each criterion you should specify the
<b>Threshold Value</b> and whether we search for the elements that should be
\b More, \b Less or \b Equal to this \b Value. You can also nagate the
sense of a criterion using \b Unary operator Not and you should
specify logical relations between criteria using \b Binary operators
Or and And.
\n Some criteria should have the additional parameter of \b Tolerance.

When we create a <b>Standalone Group</b> using filters (for this click
<b>Set Filters</b> button in the <b>Create Group</b> menu), the menu
for setting filters looks a bit differently. Toggling <b>Insert filter
in viewer</b> checkbox enables to preview the group selected with your
current filter in the viewer.
\n In the \b Source field you choose if the filter will be applied to
the whole \b Mesh, the <b>Initial Selection</b> or the <b>Current Group</b>. 
\n <b>Copy from...</b> button gives you a possibility to load an
existing filter from <b>Selection filter library</b> and <b>Add
to...</b> button gives you a possibility to save your current filter
in the Library.
\n <b>Note:</b> If button <b>Apply and Close</b> is disabled, there
is no selected mesh in Object Browser and the filter can not be
created. You have to select the mesh and the button will be enabled.

Some criteria are applicable to all <b>Entity types</b>:
<ul><li>
<b>Belong to Geom</b> selects entities whose all nodes
lays on the shape defined by <b>Threshold Value</b>.
The threshold shape can be sub-shape of the main shape of mesh, in
this case the algorithm works fast, and it also can be any other
shape, but in this case the algorithm works slower.
</li><li>
<b>Lying on Geom</b> selects entities whose at least one node
lays on the shape defined by <b>Threshold Value</b>.
The threshold shape can be sub-shape of the main shape of mesh, in
this case the algorithm works fast, and it also can be any other
shape, but in this case the algorithm works slower.
</li><li>
<b>Range of IDs</b> allows selection of entities having certain
IDs. <b>Threshold Value</b> can be like this: "1,2,3,50-60,63,67,70-78"
</li>
</ul>

The following criteria are applicable to all <b>Entity types</b> except <b>Volumes</b>:
<ul><li>
<b>Belong to Plane</b> selects entities whose all nodes belong to a
specified plane within a given <b>Tolerance</b>.
</li><li>
<b>Belong to Cylinder</b> selects entities whose all nodes belong to a
specified cylinder within a given <b>Tolerance</b>.
</li><li>
<b>Belong to Surface</b> selects entities whose all nodes belong to a
specified arbitrary surface within a given <b>Tolerance</b>.
</li>
</ul>

Additional criteria to select mesh <b>Edges</b> are the following:
<ul><li>
<b>Free Borders</b> selects free 1D mesh elements, i.e. edges belonging to 
one face only. See also a
\ref free_borders_page "Free Borders quality control".
</li><li>
<b>Borders at Multi-Connections</b> selects edges belonging to several faces.
The number of faces should be more, less or equal (within a given <b>Tolerance</b>)
to the predefined <b>Threshold Value</b>. See also a
\ref borders_at_multi_connection_page "Borders at Multi-Connection quality control".
</li><li>
<b>Length</b> selects edges with a value of length, which is more, less or equal
(within a given <b>Tolerance</b>) to the predefined <b>Threshold Value</b>.
See also a
\ref length_page "Length quality control".
</li>
</ul>

Additional criteria to select mesh <b>Faces</b> are the following:
<ul><li>
<b>Aspect ratio</b> selects 2D mesh elements with an aspect ratio (see also an
\ref aspect_ratio_page "Aspect Ratio quality control"), which is more, less or equal
(within a given <b>Tolerance</b>) to the predefined <b>Threshold Value</b>.
</li><li>
<b>Warping</b> selects quadrangles with warping angle (see also a
\ref warping_page "Warping quality control"), which is more, less or equal
(within a given <b>Tolerance</b>) to the predefined <b>Threshold Value</b>.
</li><li>
<b>Minimum angle</b> selects triangles and quadrangles with minimum angle (see also a
\ref minimum_angle_page "Minimum angle quality control"), which is more, less or equal
(within a given <b>Tolerance</b>) to the predefined <b>Threshold Value</b>.
</li><li>
<b>Taper</b> selects quadrangles cells with taper value (see also a
\ref taper_page "Taper quality control"), which is more, less or equal (within a given
<b>Tolerance</b>) to the predefined <b>Threshold Value</b>.
</li><li>
<b>Skew</b> selects triangles and quadrangles with skew value (see also a
\ref skew_page "Skew quality control"), which is more, less or equal (within a given
<b>Tolerance</b>) to the predefined <b>Threshold Value</b>.
</li><li>
<b>Area</b> selects triangles and quadrangles with a value of area (see also an
\ref area_page "Area quality control"), which is more, less or equal (within a given
<b>Tolerance</b>) to the predefined <b>Threshold Value</b>.
</li><li>
<b>Free edges</b> selects 2D mesh elements consisting of edges belonging to 
one element of mesh only. See also a
\ref free_edges_page "Free Edges quality control".
</li><li>
<b>Borders at Multi-Connections 2D</b> selects cells consisting of edges belonging to
several elements of mesh. The number of mesh elements should be more, less or equal
(within a given <b>Tolerance</b>) to the predefined <b>Threshold Value</b>.
See also a
\ref borders_at_multi_connection_2d_page "Borders at Multi-Connection 2D quality control".
</li><li>
<b>Length 2D</b> selects triangles and quadrangles combining of the edges with a value of
length, which is more, less or equal (within a given <b>Tolerance</b>) to the predefined
<b>Threshold Value</b>. See also a
\ref length_2d_page "Length 2D quality control".
</li>
</ul>

Additional criteria to select mesh <b>Volumes</b> are the following:
<ul><li>
<b>Aspect ratio 3D</b> selects 3D mesh elements with an aspect ratio (see also an
\ref aspect_ratio_3d_page "Aspect Ratio 3D quality control"), which is more, less or equal
(within a given <b>Tolerance</b>) to the predefined <b>Threshold Value</b>.
</li><li>
<b>Volume</b> selects 3D mesh elements with a value of volume (see also a
\ref volume_page "Volume quality control"), which is more, less or equal (within a given
<b>Tolerance</b>) to the predefined <b>Threshold Value</b>.
</li><li>
<b>Bad oriented volume</b> selects mesh volumes, which are incorrectly oriented from
the point of view of MED convention.
</li>
</ul>
