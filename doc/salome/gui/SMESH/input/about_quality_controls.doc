\n <b>Mesh quality control</b> in MESH is destined for visual control of the generated mesh.

Application of a definite quality control consists of usage of the
corresponding algorithm, which calculates a value of a definite
geometric characteristic (Area, Length of edges, etc) for all meshing
elements, composing your mesh. Then all meshing elements are colored
according the calculated values. The reference between the coloring of
the meshing elements and these calculated values is shown with the
help of a scalar bar, which is displayed near the presentation of your
mesh.

There are 1D, 2D and 3D quality controls.

1D mesh quality controls:
<ul>
<li>\ref free_borders_page "Free borders"</li>
<li>\ref borders_at_multi_connection_page "Borders at multi-connection"</li>
<li>\ref length_page "Length"</li>
</ul>

2D mesh quality controls:
<ul>
<li>\ref free_edges_page "Free edges"</li>
<li>\ref length_2d_page "Length 2D"</li>
