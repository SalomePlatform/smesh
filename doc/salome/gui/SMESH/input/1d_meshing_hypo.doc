<h2>Arithmetic 1D hypothesis</h2>

<b>Arithmetic 1D</b> hypothesis allows to split edges into segments with a
length that changes in arithmetic progression (Lk = Lk-1 + d)
beginning from a given starting length and up to a given end length.

\anchor deflection_1d_anchor
<h2>Deflection 1D hypothesis</h2>

<b>Deflection 1D</b> hypothesis can be applied for meshing curvilinear edges
composing your geometrical object. It uses only one parameter: the
value of deflection.  
\n A geometrical edge is divided into equal segments. The maximum
distance between a point on the edge within a segment and the line
connecting the ends of the segment should not exceed the specified
value of deflection . Then mesh nodes are constructed at end segment
locations and 1D mesh elements are constructed on segments.

\anchor average_length_anchor
<h2>Average Length hypothesis</h2>

<b>Average Length</b> hypothesis can be applied for meshing of edges
composing your geometrical object. Definition of this hypothesis
consists of setting the \b length of segments, which will split these
edges, and the \b precision of rounding. The points on the edges
generated by these segments will represent nodes of your mesh.
Later these nodes will be used for meshing of the faces abutting to
these edges.

The \b precision parameter is used to allow rounding a number of
segments, calculated from the edge length and average length of
segment, to the lower integer, if this value outstands from it in
bounds of the precision. Otherwise, the number of segments is rounded
to the higher integer. Use value 0.5 to provide rounding to the
nearest integer, 1.0 for the lower integer, 0.0 for the higher
integer. Default value is 1e-07.

\anchor number_of_segments_anchor
<h2>Number of segments hypothesis</h2>

<b>Number of segments</b> hypothesis can be applied for meshing of edges
composing your geometrical object. Definition of this hypothesis
consists of setting the number of segments, which will split these
edges. In other words your edges will be split into a definite number
of segments with approximately the same length. The points on the
edges generated by these segments will represent nodes of your
mesh. Later these nodes will be used for meshing of the faces abutting
to these edges.

You can set the type of distribution for this hypothesis in the
<b>Hypothesis Construction</b> dialog bog :

\image html a-nbsegments1.png

<br><b>Equidistant Distribution</b> - all segments will have the same
length, you define only the <b>Number of Segments</b>.

\image html b-mberofsegments.png

<br><b>Scale Distribution</b> - each next segment differs from the
previous according to the formula: <b>A</b>i+1 = <b>A</b>i * k, where \b k is a
<b>Scale Factor</b>.

\image html a-nbsegments2.png

<br><b>Distribution with Table Density</b> - you input a number of
pairs <b>t - F(t)</b>, where \b t ranges from 0 to 1,  and the module computes the
formula, which will rule the change of length of segments and shows
the curve in the plot. You can select the <b>Conversion mode</b> from
\b Exponent and <b>Cut negative</b>.

<br><b>Distribution with Analytic Density</b> - you input the formula,
which will rule the change of length of segments and the module shows
the curve in the plot.

\anchor start_and_end_length_anchor
<h2>Start and End Length hypothesis</h2>

<b>Start and End Length</b> hypothesis allows to divide a geometrical edge
into segments so that the first and the last segments have a specified
length. The length of each but the first segment differs from length
of the previous one by a constant factor. Then mesh nodes are
constructed at segment ends location and 1D mesh elements are
constructed on them.

\anchor automatic_length_anchor
<h2>Automatic Length</h2>

This hypothesis is automatically applied when you select <b>Assign a
set of hypotheses</b> option in Create Mesh menu.

The dialog box prompts you to define the quality of the future mesh by
only one parameter, which is \b Fineness, ranging from 0 (coarse mesh,
low number of elements) to 1 (extremely fine mesh, great number of
elements). Compare one and the same object (sphere) meshed with
minimum and maximum value of this parameter.
