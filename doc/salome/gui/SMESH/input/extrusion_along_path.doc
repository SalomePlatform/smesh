\page extrusion_along_path_page Extrusion along Path

\n In principle, <b>Extrusion along Path</b> works in the same way
as \ref extrusion_page "Extrusion", the main difference is that we
define not a vector, but a path of extrusion which must be an 1D mesh
or 1D sub-mesh.
To get an idea of how this algorithm works, examine several examples,
starting from the most simple case of extrusion along a straight edge.
In the examples the sample mesh will be extruded along different
paths and with different parameters.
This 2D mesh has two quadrangle faces and seven edges. Look
at the picture, where white digits are the node numbers and green
are the element numbers:

\image html straight_after.png
<center> The image shows the result of extrusion of two edges
(#1 and #2) of the initial mesh along the path. \n Node #1 of path mesh
has been selected as Start node.</center>

<br><center><h2>Extrusion along a curvilinear edge</h2>(with and
without angles)</center>

<center>The image shows a 1D path mesh, built on curvilinear edge, and
the initial  2D mesh.</center>

\image html curvi_simple_after.png
<center>The central image shows the result of extrusion of one edge
(#2) of the initial mesh along the path. \n Node #1 of path mesh has
been selected as <b>Start node</b>.</center>

\image html curvi_angles_after.png
<center>The same, but using angles {45, 45, 45, 0, -45, -45, -45}</center>

<br><center><h2>Extrusion of a 2D face along a mesh built on a wire</h2></center>

In this example the path mesh has been built on a wire containing 3
edges. Node 1 is a start node. Linear angle variation by 180 degrees
has also been applied.

\image html circle_simple_after.png
<center>The central image shows the result of extrusion of both faces
of the initial mesh. \n Note, that no sewing has been done, so, there are
six coincident nodes and two coincident faces in the resulting
mesh.</center>

<br><em>To use Extrusion along Path:</em>
<ol>
<li>From the \b Modification menu choose the <b>Extrusion along a
path</b> item or click <em>"Extrusion along a path"</em> button in the toolbar.

\image html image101.png
<center><em>"Extrusion along a path" button</em></center>

The following dialog will appear:

\image html extrusion_along_path_dlg.png
</li>

<li>In this dialog:
<ul>
    <li>Use \a Selection button to specify what you are going to
    select at a given moment, \b Nodes, \b Edges or \b Faces.
\image html image120.png
<center><em>"Selection" button</em></center>
    </li>
    <li>Specify \b Nodes, \b Edges and \b Faces, which will be extruded, by one
      of following means:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Select the whole mesh, sub-mesh or group</b> activating this
          check-box.</li>
        <li>Choose mesh elements with the mouse in the 3D Viewer. It is
          possible to select a whole area with a mouse frame.</li>
        <li>Input the element IDs directly in <b>Node IDs</b>, <b>Edge
            IDs</b> and <b>Face IDs</b> fields. The selected elements will
          be highlighted in the viewer, if the mesh is shown there.</li>
        <li>Apply Filters. <b>Set filter</b> button allows to apply a
          filter to the selection of elements. See more about filters in
          the \ref filtering_elements "Selection filters" page.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Define the \b Path along which the elements will be extruded.<br>
      Path definition consists of several elements:
      <ul>
        <li><b>Mesh or sub-mesh</b> - 1D mesh or sub-mesh, along which
        proceeds the extrusion.</li>
        <li><b>Start node</b> - the start node of the Path. It is used
        to define the direction of extrusion. </li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  <li>If you activate <b>Generate Groups</b> check-box, the <em>result elements</em>
    created from <em>selected elements</em> contained in groups will be
    included into new groups named by pattern "<old group
    name>_extruded" and "<old group name>_top". For example if a
    selected quadrangle is included in \a g_Faces group (see figures
    below) then result hexahedra will be included in \a
    g_Faces_extruded group and a quadrangle created at the "top" of
    extruded mesh will be included in \a g_Faces_top group. <br> 
\image html extrusion_groups.png
\image html extrusion_groups_res.png
    <p> This check-box is active only if there are some groups in the mesh.
  </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>There are two optional parameters, which can be very useful:
<ul>
<li>If the path of extrusion is curvilinear, at each iteration the
  extruded elements are rotated to keep its initial angularity to the
  curve. By default, the <b>Base Point</b> around which the elements
  are rotated is the mass center of the elements (note that it can
  differ from the gravity center computed by \a Geometry module for the
  underlying shape), however, you can specify any point as the <b>Base
  Point</b> and the elements will be rotated with respect to this
  point.<br>
  Note that only the displacement of the <b>Base Point</b> exactly
  equals to the path, and all other extruded elements simply keep
  their position relatively to the <b>Base Point</b> at each
  iteration.</li>
<li>The elements can also be rotated around the path to get the
  resulting mesh in a helical fashion. You can set the values of
  angles at the right, add them to the list of angles at the left by
  pressing the <em>"Add"</em> button and remove them from the list by
  pressing the <em>"Remove"</em> button.
\image html add.png
<center><em>"Add" button</em></center>
\image html remove.png
<center><em>"Remove" button</em></center>

<b>Linear variation of the angles</b> option allows defining the angle
of gradual rotation for the whole path. At each step the elements will
be rotated by <code>( angle / nb. of steps )</code>.
</li>
</ul>
</li>


<li>Click \b Apply or <b> Apply and Close</b>  button to confirm the
  operation. Mesh edges will be extruded into faces, faces into
  volumes. The external surface of the resulting 3d mesh (if faces
  have been extruded) is covered with faces, and corners with
  edges. If the path is closed, the resulting mesh can contain
  duplicated nodes and faces, because no sewing is done.
</li>
</ol>
