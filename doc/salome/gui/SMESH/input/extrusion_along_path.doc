\page extrusion_along_path_page Extrusion along a path

\n In principle, <b>Extrusion along a path</b> works in the same way
as \b Extrusion, the main difference is that we define not a vector,
but a path of extrusion which must be a meshed edge. To get an idea of
how this algorithm works, examine several examples, starting from the
most simple case of extrusion along a straight edge. In all examples
the same mesh will be extruded along different paths and with
different parameters. This sample 2D mesh has two quadrangle faces and
seven edges. Look at the picture, where white digits are the node
numbers and green are the element numbers:

or angles)</center>

<center>The image shows a 1D path mesh, built on a linear edge, and the initial 2D mesh.</center>

\image html straight_after.png
<center> The image shows the result of extrusion of two edges
(#1 and #2) of the initial mesh along the path. \n Node #1 of path mesh
has been selected as Start node.</center>

<br><center><h2>Extrusion along a curvilinear edge</h2>(with and
without angles)</center>

<center>The image shows a 1D path mesh, built on curvilinear edge, and
the initial  2D mesh.</center>

\image html curvi_simple_after.png
<center>The central image shows the result of extrusion of one edge
(#2) of the initial mesh along the path. \n Node #1 of path mesh has
been selected as <b>Start node</b>.</center>

\image html curvi_angles_after.png
<center>The same, but using angles {45, 45, 45, 0, -45, -45, -45}</center>

<br><center><h2>Extrusion along a sub-mesh</h2></center>

In this example the path mesh has been built on a wire (polyline with
six edges). The first edge of the wire was used as <b>Shape (edge)</b>, node
#1 as <b>Start node</b>. The angles have been defined as {10, 10, 10}. The
middle edge (#4) of the initial mesh has been extruded.

<br><center><h2>Extrusion of 2d elements along a sub-mesh</h2></center>

This extrusion bases on the same path mesh as in the previous example
but the third edge of the wire was set as <b>Shape (edge)</b> and node
#4 as <b>Start node</b>. Please note, that the extrusion has been done
in direction from node #4 to node #3, i.e. against the wire
direction. In this example both faces of the initial mesh have been
extruded.

(circle).</center>

\image html circle_simple_after.png
<center>The central image shows the result of extrusion of both faces
of the initial mesh. \n Note, that no sewing has been done, so, there are
six coincident nodes and two coincident faces in the resulting
mesh.</center>

<br><em>To use Extrusion along a path:</em>
<ol>
<li>From the \b Modification menu choose the <b>Extrusion along a
path</b> item or click <em>"Extrusion along a path"</em> button in the toolbar.

\image html image101.png
<center><em>"Extrusion along a path" button</em></center>

The following dialog box will appear:

\image html extrusion1.png

\image html extrusion2.png
</li>

<li>In the dialog box you should:
<ul>
<li>select the type of elements which will be extruded (1D or 2D),</li>
<li>specify the <b>IDs of the elements</b> which will be extruded
<ul>
<li>Check on <b>Select the whole mesh, submesh or group</b> option
<li>Choosing them manually with the mouse in the 3D Viewer. You can
click on an element in the 3D viewer and it will be highlighted</li>
<li>Applying Filters. The <b>Set filter</b> button allows to apply a
definite filter to selection of the elements. See more
about filters on the
\ref selection_filter_library_page "Selection filter library" page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>define the Path along which the elements will be extruded,
\n Path definition consists of several elements:
<ul>
<li>\b Mesh - containing a 1D sub-mesh on the edge, along which proceeds the extrusion</li>
<li><b>Shape (edge)</b> - as the mesh can be complex, the edge is used to define the sub-mesh for the path</li>
<li><b>Start node</b> - the first or the last node on the edge. It is used to define the direction of extrusion </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <b>Generate Groups</b> checkbox allows copying the groups of
elements of the source mesh to the newly created one. </li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>There are two optional parameters, which can be very useful:
<ul>
<li>If the path of extrusion is curvilinear, at each iteration the
extruded shape is rotated to keep its initial angularity to the
curve. By default, the <b>Base Point</b> around which the shape is rotated is
the mass center of the shape, however, you can specify any point as
the <b>Base Point</b> and the shape will be rotated with respect to this
point.
</li>
<li>The shape can also be rotated around the path to get the resulting
mesh in a helical fashion. You can set the values of angles at the
right, add them to the list of angles at the left by pressing the <em>"Add"</em>
button and remove them from the list by pressing the <em>"Remove"</em> button. 

\image html add.png
<center><em>"Add" button</em></center>

\image html remove.png
<center><em>"Remove" button</em></center>

<b>Linear variation of the angles</b> option allows defining the angle of gradual rotation for the whole path. 
At each step the shape will be rotated by angle/nb. of steps. 

</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Click the \b Apply or \b OK button. Mesh edges will be extruded into
faces, faces into volumes. The external surface of the resulting 3d
mesh (if faces have been extruded) is covered with faces, and corners
with edges. If the path is closed, the resulting mesh can contain
duplicated nodes and faces, because no sewing is done.
</li>
</ol>
