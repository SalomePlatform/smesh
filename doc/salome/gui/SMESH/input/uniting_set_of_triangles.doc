\page uniting_set_of_triangles_page Uniting a set of triangles

\n In contrast to the previous operation this one allows to unite at
once many triangles if they have adjacent edges.

<em>To union several triangles:</em>
<ol>
<li>Display a mesh or a submesh in the 3D viewer.</li>
<li>In the \b Modification menu select the <b>Union of triangles</b>
item or click <em>"Union of triangles"</em> button in the toolbar.

<ul>
<li><b>The main list</b> shall contain the triangles which will be
united. You can click on an triangle in the 3D viewer and it will be
highlighted. After that click the \b Add button and the ID of this
triangle will be added to the list. To remove a selected element or
elements from the list click the \b Remove button. The \b Sort button allows
to sort the list of IDs. The <b>Set filter</b> button allows to apply a
definite filter to selection of triangles.</li>
<li><b>Apply to all</b> radio button allows to modify connectivity and
type of all triangles of the currently displayed mesh or submesh.</li>
<li>\b Criterion menu allows to apply the operation only to those
object which meet the chosen criterion (from the list of Quality
Controls, i.e. Skew, Warping, Minimum Angle, etc.)</li>
<li><b>Select from</b> set of fields allows to choose a submesh or an
existing group whose triangle elements will be automatically added to
the list.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Click the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button to confirm the operation.</li>
</ol>

If some selected triangle elements have no adjacent edges with one of
the others, the operation on these elements shall take no effect.
