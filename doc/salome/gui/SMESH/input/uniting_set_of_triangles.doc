\n It is possible to unite many neighboring triangles into
quadrangles by deletion of the common edge.

<em>To union several triangles:</em>
<ol>
<li>Select a mesh (and display it in the 3D Viewer if you are going to
  pick elements by mouse).</li>
<li>In the \b Modification menu select the <b>Union of triangles</b>
  item or click <em>"Union of triangles"</em> button in the tool-bar.

The following dialog box will appear:

<ul>
<li><b>The main list</b> shall contain the triangles which will be
  united. You can click on a triangle in the 3D viewer and it will be
  highlighted. After that click the \b Add button and the ID of this
  triangle will be added to the list. To remove a selected element or
  elements from the list click the \b Remove button. The \b Sort button allows
  to sort the list of IDs. The <b>Filter</b> button allows to apply a
  definite \ref filtering_elements "filter" to selection of triangles.</li>
<li><b>Apply to all</b> radio button allows to apply the operation to
  all triangles of the selected mesh.</li>
<li><b>Preview</b> provides a preview in the viewer.</li>
<li>\b Criterion menu allows to choose a quality criterion,
  which will be optimized to select triangles to unite.</li>
<li><b>Select from</b> set of fields allows to choose a sub-mesh or an
  existing group whose triangle elements then can be added to the
  list.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Click the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button to confirm the operation.</li>
</ol>

If some selected triangle elements have no adjacent edges with one of
the others, the operation on these elements shall take no effect.
