triangle will be added to the list. To remove a selected element or
elements from the list click the \b Remove button. The \b Sort button allows
to sort the list of IDs. The <b>Set filter</b> button allows to apply a
definite filter to selection of triangles.</li>
<li><b>Apply to all</b> radio button allows to modify connectivity and
type of all triangles of the currently displayed mesh or submesh.</li>
<li>\b Criterion menu allows to apply the operation only to those
object which meet the chosen criterion (from the list of Quality
Controls, i.e. Skew, Warping, Minimum Angle, etc.)</li>
<li><b>Select from</b> set of fields allows to choose a submesh or an
existing group whose triangle elements will be automatically added to
the list.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>Click the \b Apply or \b OK button to confirm the operation.</li>

If some selected triangle elements have no adjacent edges with one of
