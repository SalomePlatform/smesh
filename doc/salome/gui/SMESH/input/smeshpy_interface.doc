\page smeshpy_interface_page Python interface smesh.py

\n Python package smesh defines several classes, destined for easy and
clear mesh creation and edition (see the \ref introduction_to_mesh_python_page "example").

\n Please draw your attention to the below notes before address to
the \ref smeshDC "documentation for smesh.py"

\n 1. The main page of the \ref smeshDC "documentation for smesh.py"
      contains a list of data structures and a list of functions,
      provided by the package smesh.py. The first item in the data
      structures list (\ref smeshDC::smeshDC "class smesh") also
      represents documentation for methods of the package smesh.py itself.

\n 2. Package smesh.py gives interface to create and manage
      meshes. Please, use it to create an empty mesh or to import
      it from data file.

\n 3. Once you have created a mesh, you can manage it via its own
      methods. See \ref smeshDC::Mesh "class Mesh" documentation for
      them (it is also accessible by the second item "class Mesh" in the
      data structures list).

\n 4. Class Mesh allows to assign algorithms to a mesh. To add hypotheses,
      please use interfaces, provided by the assigned algorithms.
