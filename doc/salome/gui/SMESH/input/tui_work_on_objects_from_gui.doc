\page tui_work_on_objects_from_gui How to work with objects from the GUI ?

It is sometimes useful to work alternatively in the GUI of SALOME and in the Python Console. To fetch an object from the TUI simply type:

\code{.py}
myMesh_ref = salome.IDToObject( ID )
# were ID is a string looking like "0:1:2:3" that appears in the Object Browser in the Entry column.
# ( If hidden, show it by right clicking and checking the checkbox Entry )
myMesh = smesh.Mesh(myMesh_ref)
\endcode
or 
\code{.py}
myMesh_ref = salome.myStudy.FindObjectByPath("/Mesh/myMesh").GetObject() 
#'/Mesh/myMesh' is a path to the desired object in the Object Browser
myMesh = smesh.Mesh(myMesh_ref)
\endcode
or 
\code{.py}
# get a selected mesh
from salome.gui import helper
myMesh_ref = helper.getSObjectSelected()[0].GetObject() 
myMesh = smesh.Mesh(myMesh_ref)
\endcode

All the methods documented in these pages can then be used on myMesh

\note The first statement only gives you access to a reference to the object created via the GUI. 
\n But the methods available on this reference are not exactly the same as those documented in these help pages. 
This Python API is meant to be used on smesh.Mesh instances. 
\n That's why you'll have to create such an instance with the second statement.
