\n <b>Segments around Vertex</b> algorithm is considered to be a 0D meshing
algorithm, but, of course, it doesn't mesh nodes. It allows to define
the local size of the elements in the neighborhood of a certain
node. If we choose an object of higher dimension, it applies to all
its tops, i.e. corners of a box.  The 0D algorithm combines with the
algorithms of higher dimensions, but it is not necessarily required
for their successful implementation.

This algorithm allows only one hypothesis.
