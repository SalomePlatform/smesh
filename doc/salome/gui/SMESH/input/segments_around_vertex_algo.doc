\n <b>Segments around Vertex</b> algorithm is considered to be a 0D meshing
algorithm, but, of course, it doesn't mesh vertices. It allows to define
the local size of the segments in the neighborhood of a certain
vertex. If we assign this algorithm to a geometrical object of higher
dimension, it applies to all its vertices.

Length of segments near vertex is defined by <b> Length Near
  Vertex </b> hypothesis.
This hypothesis is used by \ref a1d_algos_anchor "Wire Discretization" or
\ref a1d_algos_anchor "Composite Side Discretization" algorithms as
follows: a geometrical edge is discretized according to a 1D
  hypotheses and then nodes near vertices are modified to assure the
  segment length required by <b> Length Near Vertex </b> hypothesis.
