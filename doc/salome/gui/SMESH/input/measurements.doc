\page measurements_page Measurements

Mesh module provides possibility to perform different measurements
of the selected mesh data.

All the measurement operations are available via \b Measurements
top-level menu. An access to the measurements operations is
implemented via single dialog box, where each operation is represented
as a separate tab page.

\section min_distance_anchor Minimum Distance

This operation allows measuring a distance between two objects.
Currently only node-to-node and node-to-origin operations are
available, but this operation will be extended in future to support
other mesh objects - elements, meshes, sub-meshes and groups.

To start <b>Minimum Distance</b> operation, select <b>Minimum Distance</b>
item from \b Measurements menu.

In the dialog box choose the first target and second target mode by
switching the corresponding radio buttons, then select the objects
between which the distance is to be calculated (or enter directly IDs
in case of nodes/elements) and press \em Compute button.

The following types of targets are supported:
- \em Node: single mesh node;
- \em Element: single mesh element (not available in this version);
- \em Object: mesh, sub-mesh or group object (not available in this
version);
- \em Origin: origin of the global co-ordinate system.

The result will
be shown in the bottom area of the dialog box. In addition, the simple
preview will be shown in the 3D viewer.

\section bounding_box_anchor Bounding Box

This operation allows to calculate the bounding box of the selected
object(s).

To start <b>Bounding Box</b> operation, select <b>Bounding Box</b>
item from \b Measurements menu.

In the dialog box choose desired type of the object by switching the
corresponding radio button, select the desired object(s) and press
\em Compute button.

The following types of input are available:
- \em Objects: select one or more mesh, sub-mesh, group objects;
- \em Nodes: select set of mesh nodes;
- \em Elements: select set of mesh elements.

The result of calculation will be shown in the bottom area of the
dialog box. In addition, the simple preview will be shown in the 3D
viewer.
