\page over_constrained_faces_page Over-constrained faces

\n This mesh quality control highlights faces sharing only one border
with other faces. In other words, the faces having all thier nodes on
the external border of the mesh are highlighted.

\note The highlighted faces are actually over-constrained only if, at the computation time, 
the boundary conditions on the borders where the nodes are located are all Dirichlet boundary conditions.

In this picture the over-constrained face is displayed in red.
