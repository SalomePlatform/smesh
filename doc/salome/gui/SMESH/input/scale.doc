\page scale_page Scale

\n This geometrical operation allows to scale in space your mesh
or some of its elements.

<em>To scale a mesh:</em>

<ol>
<li>From the \b Modification menu choose \b Transformation -> \b Scale
\b Transform item.

One of the following dialogs will appear:

With one scale factor:
\image html scale01.png

Or with different scale factors for axes:
\image html scale02.png

</li>

<li>
In the dialog:
<ul>
<li>specify the IDs of the translated elements:

<ul>
<li><b>Select the whole mesh, submesh or group</b> activating this
checkbox; or</li>
<li>choose mesh elements with the mouse in the 3D Viewer. It is
possible to select a whole area with a mouse frame; or</li> 
<li>input the element IDs directly in <b>ID Elements</b> field. The selected elements will be highlighted in the
viewer; or</li>
<li>apply Filters. <b>Set filter</b> button allows to apply a filter to the selection of elements. See more
about filters in the \ref selection_filter_library_page "Selection filter library" page.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>specify the base point for scale</li>

<li>specify the scale factor</li>

<li>specify the conditions of scale:
<ul>
<li>activate <b>Move elements</b> radio button to create  the source
mesh (or elements) at the new location and erase it from the previous location;</li>
<li>activate <b>Copy elements</b> radio button to create the source
mesh (or elements) at the new location, but leave it at the previous
location, the source mesh will be considered one and single mesh with
the result of the scale operation;</li>
<li>activate <b>Create as new mesh</b> radio button to leave the
source mesh (or elements) at its previous location and create a new
mesh at the new location, the new mesh appears in the Object Browser
with the default name MeshName_scaled (it is possible to change this
name in the adjacent box);</li>
<li>activate <b> Copy groups </b> checkbox to copy the groups of elements of the source mesh to the newly created mesh.</li>
</ul>
</li>

</li>

<li>Click \b Apply or <b> Apply and Close</b> button to confirm the operation.</li>
</ul>
</ol>



<b>Example of using:</b>

1. Create quandrangle mesh 3x3 on simple planar face (200x200)

\image html scaleinit01.png

and union 3 face (along axis Z) to group "gr_faces"

\image html scaleinit02.png



2. Perform scale operation for whole mesh with creation of new mesh:

\image html scale03.png

result after operation:

\image html scaleres03.png



3. Perform scale operation for whole mesh with copy of elements:

\image html scale04.png

result after operation:

\image html scaleres04.png



4. Perform scale operation for group of faces with copy of elements:

\image html scale06.png

result after operation:

\image html scaleres06.png



5. Perform scale operation for two edges with moving of elements:

\image html scale07.png

result after operation:

\image html scaleres07.png



6. Perform scale operation for one face with moving of elements:

\image html scale09.png

result after operation:
