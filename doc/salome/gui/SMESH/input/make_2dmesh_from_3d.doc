\page make_2dmesh_from_3d_page Generate boundary elements

\n This functionality allows to generate mesh elements on the borders of
elements of a higher dimension.

<em>To generate border elements:</em>
<ol>
<li>From the Modification menu choose "Create boundary elements"
item, or click "Create boundary elements" button in the toolbar

The following dialog box will appear:
\image html 2d_from_3d_dlg.png "Create boundary elements dialog box".
</li>
<li>Check in the dialog box one of three radio buttons corresponding to
the type of operation you would like to perform.</li>
<li>Fill the other fields available in the dialog box.</li>
<li>Click the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button to perform the operation.</li>
</ol>

\n "Create boundary elements" dialog allows creation of boundary elements
of three types.
<ul>
<li><b>2D from 3D</b> creates mesh faces on free facets of volume elements</li>
<li><b>1D from 2D</b> creates mesh edges on free edges of mesh faces</li>
<li><b>1D from 3D</b> creates mesh edges on all borders of free facets of volume elements</li>
</ul>
Here a <em>free facet</em> means a facet shared by only one volume, a <em>free edge</em>
means an edge shared by only one mesh face.

In this dialog:
<ul>
<li>specify the <b>Mesh, submesh or group</b>, the boundary which of
will be analyzed.</li>
<li>specify the <b>Target</b> mesh, where the boundary elements will
  be created.
  <ul>
  <li><b>This mesh</b> adds elements in the selected mesh or the mesh
  the selected submesh or group belongs to.</li>
  <li><b>New mesh</b> adds elements to a new mesh. The new mesh appears
  in the Object Browser with the name that you can change in the adjacent box. </li>
  </ul></li>
<li>activate <b>Copy source mesh</b> checkbox to copy 2D or 3D
  elements (depending on the operation type), which belong to the analyzed 
<b>Mesh, submesh or group</b> field, to the new mesh.</li>
<li>deactivate <b>Copy missing elements only</b> checkbox to copy
  boundary elements already present in the analyzed mesh to the
  new mesh.</li>
<li>activate <b>Create group</b> checkbox to create a group to which the
  missing boundary elements are added. The new group appears
  in the Object Browser with the name that you can change in the adjacent box. </li>
</ul>
