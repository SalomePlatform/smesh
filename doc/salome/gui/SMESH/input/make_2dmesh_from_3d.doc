The algorithm detects boundary volume faces without connections to
other volumes and creates 2D mesh elements on face nodes. If the mesh
already contains 2D elements on the detected nodes, new elements are not
created. The the resulting dialog shows mesh information statistics
about the newly created 2D mesh elements.
</ol>
