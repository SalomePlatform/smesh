\page make_2dmesh_from_3d_page Generate boundary elements

\n This functionality allows to generate mesh elements on the borders of
elements of a higher dimension, for example, to create 2D elements
around a block of 3D elements as in the following figure.

\image html 2d_from_3d_example.png "Missing 2D elements were generated"

<em>To generate border elements:</em>
<ol>
<li>Select a mesh or group in the Object Browser or in the 3D Viewer</li>
<li>From the Modification menu choose "Create boundary elements"
item, or click "Create boundary elements" button in the toolbar

The following dialog box will appear:
\image html 2d_from_3d_dlg.png "Create boundary elements dialog box".
</li>
<li>Check in the dialog box one of two radio buttons corresponding to
the type of operation you would like to perform.</li>
<li>Fill the other fields available in the dialog box.</li>
<li>Click the \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button to perform the operation.</li>
</ol>

\n "Create boundary elements" dialog allows creation of boundary elements
of two types.
<ul>
<li><b>2D from 3D</b> creates missing mesh faces on free facets of volume elements</li>
<li><b>1D from 2D</b> creates missing mesh edges on free edges of mesh faces</li>
</ul>
Here a <em>free facet</em> means a facet shared by only one volume, a <em>free edge</em>
means an edge shared by only one mesh face.

In this dialog:
<ul>
<li>specify the <b>Target</b> mesh, where the boundary elements will
  be created.
  <ul>
  <li><b>This mesh</b> adds elements in the selected mesh.</li>
  <li><b>New mesh</b> adds elements to a new mesh. The new mesh appears
    in the Object Browser with the name that you can change in the adjacent box. </li>
  </ul></li>
<li>activate <b>Copy source mesh</b> checkbox to copy all elements of
the selected mesh to the new mesh, else the new mesh will contain only
boundary elements (old and created by this operation).</li>
<li>activate <b>Create group</b> checkbox to create a group to which
  all the boundary elements (old and new) are added. The new group appears
  in the Object Browser with the name that you can change in the adjacent box. </li>
</ul>
