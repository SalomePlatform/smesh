\page additional_hypo_page Additional Hypotheses

\n <b>Additional Hypotheses</b> can be applied as a supplement to the
main hypotheses, introducing additional concepts to mesh creation.

To define an <b>Additional Hypothesis</b> simply select it in
<b>Create Mesh</b> menu. These hypotheses are actually changes in the
rules of mesh creation and as such don't possess adjustable values.

<h2>Non Conform mesh allowed hypothesis</h2>

<b>Non Conform mesh allowed</b> hypothesis allows to generate non-conform
meshes (that is, meshes having some edges ending on an edge or face of
adjacent elements).

<h2>Quadratic Mesh</h2>

Quadratic Mesh hypothesis allows to build a quadratic mesh (whose
edges are not straight but broken lines and can be defined by three
points: first, middle and last) instead of an ordinary one.

<h2>Propagation of 1D Hypothesis on opposite edges</h2>

<b>Propagation of 1D Hypothesis on opposite edges</b> allows to propagate a
hypothesis onto an opposite edge. If a local hypothesis and
propagation are defined on an edge of a quadrangular face, the
opposite edge will have the same hypothesis, unless another hypothesis
has been locally defined on the opposite edge.

\ref tui_propagation "Propagation hypothesis" operation.
