\page additional_hypo_page Additional Hypotheses

\n <b>Additional Hypotheses</b> can be applied as a supplement to the
main hypotheses, introducing additional concepts to mesh creation.

To define an <b>Additional Hypothesis</b> simply select it in
<b>Create Mesh</b> menu. These hypotheses are actually changes in the
rules of mesh creation and as such don't possess adjustable values.

<h2>Non Conform mesh allowed hypothesis</h2>

<b>Non Conform mesh allowed</b> hypothesis allows to generate non-conform
meshes (that is, meshes having some edges ending on an edge or face of
adjacent elements).

<h2>Quadratic Mesh</h2>

Quadratic Mesh hypothesis allows to build a quadratic mesh (whose
edges are not straight but broken lines and can be defined by three
points: first, middle and last) instead of an ordinary one.

<h2>Propagation of 1D Hypothesis on opposite edges</h2>

<b>Propagation of 1D Hypothesis on opposite edges</b> allows to propagate a
hypothesis onto an opposite edge. If a local hypothesis and
propagation are defined on an edge of a quadrangular face, the
opposite edge will have the same hypothesis, unless another hypothesis
has been locally defined on the opposite edge.

<h2>Viscous Layers</h2>

<b>Viscous Layers</b> additional hypotheses can be used together with
several 3D algorithms: NETGEN 3D, GHS3D and Hexahedron(i,j,k). This
hypothesis allows creation of layers of highly stretched prisms near
mesh boundary, which is beneficial for high quality viscous
computations. The prisms constructed on the quadrangular mesh faces are
actually the hexahedrons.

<ul>
<li><b>Name</b> - allows to define the name of the hypothesis.</li>
<li><b>Total thicknes</b> - gives total thickness of layers of prisms.</li>
<li><b>Number of layers</b> - defines number of layers of prisms.</li>
<li><b>Stretch factor</b> - defines factor of growth of height of
prisms from the mesh boundary towards inside of mesh.</li>
<li><b>Faces without layers</b> - defines geometrical faces on which
layers of prisms should not be constructed. By default the layers of
prisms are not constructed on geometrical faces shared by solids.</li>
</ul>
