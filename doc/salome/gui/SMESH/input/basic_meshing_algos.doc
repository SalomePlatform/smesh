\n The MESH module contains a set of meshing algorithms, which are
used for meshing entities (1D, 2D, 3D) composing geometrical objects.

<ul>
<li>For meshing of 1D entities (<b>edges</b>):</li>

<ul>
<li>Wire Discretisation meshing algorithm - splits a wire into a
number of mesh segments following any 1D hypothesis.</li>
<li>Composite Side Discretisation algorithm - allows to apply any 1D
hypothesis to a whole side of a geometrical face even if it is
composed of several edges provided that they form C1 curve, have the
same hypotheses assigned and form one side in all faces of the main
shape of a mesh.</li>
</ul>

<li>For meshing of 2D entities (<b>faces</b>):</li>

<ul>
<li>Triangle meshing algorithms (Mefisto, Netgen 1D-2D and BLSUFR ) - Faces
are split into triangular elements.</li>
<li>Quadrangle meshing algorithm (Mapping) - Faces are split into
quadrangular elements.</li>
</ul>

<li>For meshing of 3D entities (<b>volume objects</b>):</li>

<ul>
<li>Hexahedron meshing algorithm (i,j,k) - Volumes are split into
hexahedral (cubic) elements.</li>
<li>Tetrahedron (Netgen and GHS3D) meshing algorithms - Volumes are split into
tetrahedral (pyramidal) elements.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

\Note that BLSURF and GHS3D are commercial meshers and require a
license to be used within the Mesh module.

There is also a number of more specific algorithms:
<ul>
<li>\subpage projection_algos_page "for meshing by projection of another mesh"</li>
<li>\subpage radial_prism_algo_page "for meshing geometrical objects with cavities"</li>
<li>\subpage segments_around_vertex_algo_page "for defining the local size of elements around a certain node"</li>
<li>\subpage prism_3d_algo_page "for meshing prismatic shapes"</li>
</ul>

\ref constructing_meshes_page "Constructing meshes" page describes in
detail how to apply meshing algorithms.
