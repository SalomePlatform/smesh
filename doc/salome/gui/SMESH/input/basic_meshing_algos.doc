\n The MESH module contains a set of meshing algorithms, which are
used for meshing entities (1D, 2D, 3D) composing geometrical objects.

<ul>
<li>For meshing of 1D entities (<b>edges</b>):</li>

<ul>
<li>Wire Discretisation meshing algorithm - splits a wire into a
number of mesh segments following any 1D hypothesis.</li>
<li>Composite Side Discretisation algorithm - allows to apply any 1D
hypothesis to a whole side of a geometrical face even if it is
composed of several edges provided that they form C1 curve, have the
same hypotheses assigned and form one side in all faces of the main
shape of a mesh.</li>
</ul>

<li>For meshing of 2D entities (<b>faces</b>):</li>

<ul>
<li>Triangle meshing algorithms (Mefisto) - Faces are split into triangular elements.</li>
<li>Quadrangle meshing algorithm (Mapping) - quadrilateral Faces are split into
quadrangular elements.</li>
</ul>

<li>For meshing of 3D entities (<b>volume objects</b>):</li>

<ul>
<li>Hexahedron meshing algorithm (i,j,k) - 6-sided Volumes are split into
hexahedral (cubic) elements.</li>
<li>\subpage cartesian_algo_page</li>
internal parts of Volumes are split into hexahedral elements forming a
Cartesian grid; polyhedra and other types of elements are generated
where the geometrical boundary intersects Cartesian cells.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

Some of 3D meshing algorithms also can generate 3D meshes from 2D meshes, working without
geometrical objects. Such algorithms are
<ul>
<li>Hexahedron meshing algorithm (i,j,k),</li>
<!-- <li>GHS3D meshing algorithm (commercial)</li> -->
</ul>

There is also a number of more specific algorithms:
<ul>
<li>\subpage projection_algos_page "for meshing by projection of another mesh"</li>
<li>\subpage import_algos_page "for meshing by importing elements from another mesh"</li>
<li>\subpage radial_prism_algo_page "for meshing geometrical objects with cavities"</li>
<li>\subpage segments_around_vertex_algo_page "for defining the local size of elements around a certain node"</li>
<li>\subpage prism_3d_algo_page "for meshing prismatic shapes"</li>
<li>\subpage radial_quadrangle_1D2D_algo_page "for meshing special 2d faces (circles and part of circles)"</li>
</ul>
\ref use_existing_anchor "Use existing edges" and 
\ref use_existing_anchor "Use existing faces" algorithms can be
used to create an 1D or a 2D mesh in a python script.

\ref constructing_meshes_page "Constructing meshes" page describes in
detail how to apply meshing algorithms.
