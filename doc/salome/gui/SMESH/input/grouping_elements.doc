\page grouping_elements_page Grouping elements

In Mesh module it is possible to create groups of mesh elements:
nodes, edges, faces or volumes:
<ul>
<li> by selecting the elements of the specified kind by their IDs or
directly on the presentation in the VTK viewer - <b>Standalone
group</b> tab of \subpage creating_groups_page "Create group"
dialog.</li>
<li> by creating a group of elements of the selected type from all
such elements of the chosen geometrical object - <b>Group on
geometry</b> tab of  \ref creating_groups_page "Create group" dialog.</li>
<li> by creating a group including all types of elements from an
existing geometrical object - using \subpage create_groups_from_geometry_page "Create Groups from Geometry" dialog.</li>
<li> by creating several groups of elements (nodes,
edges, faces and volumes) from the chosen submesh - using <b>Mesh -> Construct
Group</b> Menu item. In this case groups of elements are created
automatically.</li>
<li> by creating groups of entities from existing groups of superior
dimensions - using \subpage group_of_underlying_elements_page "Create Group of Underlying Elements"
dialog.</li>
</ul>


The created groups can be later:

<ul>
<li>\subpage editing_groups_page "Edited"</li>
<li>\subpage using_operations_on_groups_page "Subjected to Boolean operations"</li>
<li>\subpage deleting_groups_page "Deleted"</li>
</ul>

An important tool, providing filters for creation of \b Standalone
groups is \ref selection_filter_library_page.
