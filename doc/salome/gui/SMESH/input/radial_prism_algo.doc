\n This algorithm applies to the meshing of a hollow 3D shape,
i.e. such shape should be composed of two meshed shells: an outer
shell and an internal shell without intersection with the outer
shell. One of the shells should be a 2D Projection of the other
shell. The meshes of the shells can consist both of triangles and
quadrangles.

The Radial Prism algorithm would fill the space between the two shells
with meshes.

This algorithm also needs the information concerning the number and
distribution of mesh layers between the inner and the outer shapes.

Distribution of layers can be set with any of 1D Hypotheses.
