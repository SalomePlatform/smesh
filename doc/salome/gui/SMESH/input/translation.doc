\image html translation2.png "by the vector from the origin of coordinates" 

</li>

<li>
In the dialog:
<ul>
<li>specify the IDs of the translated elements:

<ul>
<li><b>Select the whole mesh, submesh or group</b> activating this
checkbox; or</li>

possible to select a whole area with a mouse frame; or</li> 
<li>input the element IDs directly in <b>ID Elements</b> field. The selected elements will be highlighted in the

</ul>
</li>

<li>specify the vector of translation:
<ul>
<li>specify the cooordinates of the start and end \b Points of the
vector of translation; or</li>
<li>specify the end point of the \b Vector of rotation starting at the
origin of coordinates.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>specify the conditions of translation:
<ul>
<li>activate <b>Move elements</b> radio button to create  the source
mesh (or elements) at the new location and erase it from the previous location;</li>
<li>activate <b>Copy elements</b> radio button to create the source
mesh (or elements) at the new location, but leave it at the previous
location, the source mesh will be considered one and single mesh with the result of the rotation;</li>
<li>activate <b>Create as new mesh</b> radio button to leave the
source mesh (or elements) at its previous location and create a new
mesh at the new location, the new mesh appears in the Object Browser
with the default name MeshName_rotated (it is possible to change this
name in the adjacent box);</li>
<li>activate <b> Copy groups </b> checkbox to copy the groups of elements of the source mesh to the newly created mesh.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>activate <b>Preview</b> checkbox to show the result of transformation in the viewer </li>
<li>click \b Apply or <b> Apply and Close</b> button to confirm the operation.</li>
</ul>
