**Skew** mesh quality criterion reflects the angle between the lines
that join opposite sides of a quadrangle element or the greatest angle
between a median and a midline in a triangle element. This mesh quality
criterion can be applied to elements composed of 4 and 3 nodes
(quadrangles and triangles).
