<li>one point</li>
<li>one axis (point and vector)</li>
<li>one plane (point and normal)</li>
</ul>


\n Toggle the corresponding checkbox to <b> Select whole mesh, submesh or group.</b>  
\n When <b>Move elements</b> radio button is selected, the source mesh (or elements) is created at the new location and erased from its previous location
\n When <b>Copy elements</b> radio button is selected,the source mesh (or elements) is created at the new location, but it also remains at its previous location and is considered one and single mesh with the result of the translation.
\n When <b>Create as new mesh</b> radio button is selected, the source mesh (or elements) remains at its previous location and a new mesh is created at the new location and appears in the Object Browser with the default name MeshName_mirrored (you can change this name in the adjacent box).
