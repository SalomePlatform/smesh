Now you can define the parameters of your cross-section: \b Orientation
(X-Y, X-Z or Y-Z); \b Distance between the opposite extremities of the
object, if it is set to 0.5 the object is split in two halves; and
\b Rotation (in angle degrees) <b>around X</b> (Y to Z) and <b>around Y</b> (X to
Z). If the <b>Show preview</b> button is on, you can see the clipping plane
in the <b>3D Viewer</b>.
