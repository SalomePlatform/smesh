\n Projection algorithms allow to define the mesh of a geometrical
object by the projection of another already meshed geometrical object.

<b>Projection 1D</b> algorithm permits to define the mesh of an edge
(or group of edges)
by the projection of another already meshed edge (or group of edges).
\n To apply this algorithm select the edge to be meshed (indicated in
the field \b Geometry of <b>Create mesh</b> dialog box),
<b>Projection1D</b> in the list of 1D algorithms and click the
<em>"Add Hypothesis"</em> button.
The following dialog box will appear:

In this menu you can define the \b Name of the algorithm, the algeady
meshed source \b Edge and the \b Mesh (optional, use it if there are several
different meshes on the same edge). It could also be necessary to
define the orientation of edges, which is done by indicating the
<b>Source Vertex</b> being the first point of the Source Edge and the 
<b>Target Vertex</b> being the first point of the created \b Edge. For
a group of edges, <b>Source</b> and <b>Target</b> vertices should be
shared by only one edge of the group. If <b>Source</b> and
<b>Target</b> vectors are specified, the elements of the group must be ajacent.

\n <b>Projection 2D</b> algorithm permits to define the mesh of a face
(or group of faces) by the
projection of another already meshed face (or group of faces). This
algorithm works only
if all edges of the target face have been meshed as 1D Projections of
the edges of the source face.

To apply this algorithm select the face to be meshed (indicated in the
field \b Geometry of <b>Create mesh</b> dialog box), <b>Projection
2D</b> in the list
of 2D algorithms and click the <em>"Add Hypothesis"</em> button. The
following dialog box will appear:

\image html projection_2d.png

In this menu you can define the \b Name of the algorithm, the algeady
meshed source \b Face and the \b Mesh (optional, use it if there are several
different meshes on the same face). It could also be necessary to
define the orientation of mesh on the face, which is done by
indicating two <b>Source Vertices</b>, which belong to the same edge of the
source face, and two <b>Target Vertices</b>, which belong to the same edge of
the created \b Face.

\n <b>Projection 3D</b> algorithm permits to define the mesh of a shape by
the projection of another already meshed shape.  This algorithm works
only if all faces and edges of the target face have been meshed as 1D
Projections of the faces and edges of the source face. Another
limitation is that this algorithm currently works only on boxes.

To apply this algorithm select the solid to be meshed (indicated in
the field \b Geometry of <b>Create mesh</b> dialog box), <b>Projection
3D</b> in the list of 3D algorithms and click the  button. The
following dialog box will appear:

\image html projection_3d.png

In this menu you can define the \b Name of the algorithm, the algeady
meshed source <b>3D shape</b> and the \b Mesh (optional, use it if there are
several different meshes on the same shape). It could also be
necessary to define the orientation of mesh on the shape, which is
done by indicating two <b>Source Vertices</b>, which belong to the same edge
of the source <b>3D Shape</b>, and two <b>Target Vertices</b>, which belong to the
same edge of the source <b>3D Shape</b>.
