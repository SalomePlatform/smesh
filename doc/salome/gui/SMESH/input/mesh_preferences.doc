In the Mesh module you can set mesh preferences, which can be used right now 
or in later sessions with this module according to the preferences.

<h2>General Preferences</h2>

\image html pref21.png

\anchor automatic_update_pref
- <b>Automatic Update</b>
  - <b>Automatic Update</b> - if activated, the mesh in your
    viewer will be automatically updated after it's computation, depending on
    values of additional preferences specified below.
  - <b>Size limit (elements)</b> - allows specifying the maximum
    number of elements in the resulting mesh for which the automatic updating
    of the presentation is performed. This option affects only
    \ref compute_anchor "Compute" operation. Zero value means "no
    limit". Default value is 500 000 mesh elements. 
  - <b>Incremental limit check</b> - if activated,
    the mesh size limit check is not applied to the total number of
    elements in the resulting mesh, it is applied iteratively to each entity type
    in the following order: 0D elements, edges, faces, volumes, balls.
    At each step the number of entities of a certain type is added to the
    total number of elements computed at the previous step - if the resulting
    number of elements does not exceed the size limit, the entities of
    this type are shown, otherwise the user is warned that some entities are not shown.

\anchor display_mode_pref
- <b>Display mode</b>
  - <b>Default display mode</b> - allows to set Wireframe, Shading, Nodes or Shrink
    \ref display_mode_page "presentation mode" as default.

\anchor quadratic_2d_mode_pref
- <b>Representation of the 2D quadratic elements</b>
  - <b>Default mode of the 2D quadratic elements</b> - allows to
    select either \a Lines or \a Arcs as a default
    \ref quadratic_2d_mode "representation" of 1D and 2D
    \ref adding_quadratic_elements_page "quadratic elements".
  - <b>Maximum Angle</b> - maximum deviation angle used by the
    application to build arcs.

- <b>Quality Controls</b>
  - <b>Display entity</b> - if activated, only currently
    \ref quality_page "controlled" entities are displayed in the
    viewer and other entities are temporarily hidden. For example if you
    activate \ref length_page "Length" quality control, which controls
    the length of mesh segments, then only mesh segments are
    displayed and faces and volumes are hidden. 
  - <b>Use precision</b> - if activated, all quality controls
    will be computed at precision defined by <b>Number of digits after
    point</b> - as integers by default.
\anchor dbl_nodes_tol_pref
  - <b>Double nodes tolerance</b> - defines the maximal distance between two
    mesh nodes, at which they are considered coincident by
    \ref double_nodes_control_page "Double nodes" quality control.
    This value is also used in \ref mesh_quality_info_anchor "Quality Info" 
    tab page of \ref mesh_infos_page dialog.

- <b>Mesh export</b>
\anchor export_auto_groups_pref
  - <b>Automatically create groups for MED export</b> - defines a
    default state of a corresponding check-box in \ref export_auto_groups
    "MED Export" dialog.
\anchor group_export_warning_pref
  - <b>Show warning when exporting group</b> - if activated, a warning is
    displayed when exporting a group.

\anchor show_comp_result_pref
- <b>Mesh computation</b>
  - <b>Show a computation result notification</b> - allows to
    select the notification mode about a \ref compute_anchor "mesh computation" result.
    There are 3 possible modes:
    - <b>Never</b> - not to show the \ref meshing_result_anchor "result dialog" at all;
    - <b>Errors only</b> - the result dialog will be shown if there were
      some errors during a mesh computation;
    - <b>Always</b> - show the result dialog after each mesh
      computation. This is a default mode.

\anchor mesh_information_pref
- <b>Mesh information</b>
  - <b>Mesh element information</b> - allows changing the way 
    \ref mesh_element_info_anchor "mesh element information" is shown:
    - <b>Simple</b> - as a plain text
    - <b>Tree</b> - in a tree-like form
\anchor nb_nodes_limit_pref
  - <b>Automatic nodes compute limit</b> - allows defining the size limit for the
    \ref mesh_addition_info_group_anchor "mesh groups" for which
    the number of underlying nodes is calculated
    automatically. If the group size exceeds the value set in the preferences,
    the user will have to press \em Compute button explicitly. Zero value
    means "no limit". By default the value is set to 100 000 mesh elements.
\anchor auto_control_limit_pref
  - <b>Automatic controls compute limit</b> - allows defining a
    maximal number of mesh elements for which the quality controls
    in the \ref mesh_quality_info_anchor "Quality Information" 
    tab page are calculated automatically. If the number of mesh elements
    exceeds the value set in the preferences, it is necessary to press
    \b Compute button explicitly to calculate a quality measure. Zero value
    means "no limit". By default the value is set to 3 000 mesh
    elements.
\anchor group_detail_info_pref
  - <b>Show details on groups in element information tab</b> - when
    this option is switched off (default), only the names of groups, to which the node
    or element belongs, are shown in the \ref mesh_element_info_anchor "Element Info"
    tab of "Mesh Information" dialog box. If this option is
    switched on, the detailed information on groups is shown.
  - <b>Dump base information</b> - allows dumping base mesh information to the
    file, see \ref dump_mesh_infos "Mesh Information".
  - <b>Dump element information</b> - allows dumping element information to the
    file, see \ref dump_mesh_infos "Mesh Information".
  - <b>Dump additional information</b> - allows dumping additional mesh
    information to the file, see \ref dump_mesh_infos "Mesh Information".
  - <b>Dump controls information</b> - allows dumping quality mesh
    information to the file, see \ref dump_mesh_infos "Mesh Information".

- <b>Automatic Parameters</b>
\anchor diagonal_size_ratio_pref
  - <b>Ratio Bounding Box Diagonal / Max Size</b> - defines the ratio
    between the bounding box of the meshed object and the Max Size of
    segments. It is used as a default value of \ref a1d_meshing_hypo_page
    defining length of segments, especially by 
    \ref max_length_anchor "Max Size" hypothesis.
\anchor nb_segments_pref
  - <b>Default Number of Segments</b> - defines the default number of
    segments in \ref number_of_segments_anchor "Number of Segments"
    hypothesis.

- <b>Mesh loading</b>
  - <b>No mesh loading from study file at hypothesis modification</b> - if
    activated, the mesh data will not be loaded from the study file
    when a hypothesis is modified. This allows saving time by omitting
    loading data of a large mesh that is planned to be recomputed with other parameters.

- <b>Input fields precision</b> - allows to adjust input precision of
  different parameters. The semantics of the precision values is
  described in detail in <em>Using input widgets</em> chapter of GUI
  documentation (Introduction to Salome Platform / Introduction to GUI / 
  Using input widgets). In brief: \b positive precision value is the
  maximum allowed number of digits after the decimal point in the
  fixed-point format; \b nagative precision value is the maximum
  allowed number of significant digits in mantissa in either the
  fixed-point or scientific format.
  - <b>Length precision</b> - allows to adjust input precision of coordinates and dimensions.
  - <b>Angular precision</b> - allows to adjust input precision of angles.
  - <b>Length tolerance precision</b> - allows to adjust input precision of tolerance of coordinates and dimensions.
  - <b>Parametric precision</b> - allows to adjust input precision of parametric values.
  - <b>Area precision</b> - allows to adjust input precision of mesh element area.
  - <b>Volume precision</b> - allows to adjust input precision of mesh element volume.

- <b>Preview</b>
  - <b>Sub-shapes preview chunk size</b> - allows to limit the number
    of previewed sub-shapes shown in the hypotheses creation dialog boxes,
    for example "Reverse Edges" parameter of 
    \ref number_of_segments_anchor "Number of segments" hypothesis.

- <b>Python Dump</b>
  - <b>Historical python dump</b> - allows switching between
    \a Historical and \a Snapshot dump mode:
    - In \a Historical mode, Python Dump script includes all commands
      performed by SMESH engine.
    - In \a Snapshot mode, the commands relating to objects removed
      from the Study as well as the commands not influencing the
      current state of meshes are excluded from the script.
