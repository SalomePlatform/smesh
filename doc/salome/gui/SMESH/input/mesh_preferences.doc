In the Mesh module you can set mesh preferences, which can be used right now 
or in later sessions with this module according to the preferences.

<h2>General Preferences</h2>

\image html pref21.png

- <b>Automatic Update</b>
  - If you toggle <b>Automatic Update</b> checkbox, the model in your
    viewer will be automatically updated when you make changes in it, depending on
    values of additional preferences specified below.
  - <b>Size limit (elements)</b> - allows specifying the maximum
    number of elements in the resulting mesh for which the automatic updating
    of the presentation is performed. This option affects only
    <b>Compute</b> operation. Zero value means "no limit". Default value
    is 500 000 mesh elements.
  - <b>Incremental limit check</b> - when this control is switched on,
    the mesh size limit check is not applied to the total number of
    elements in the resulting mesh, it is applied iteratively to each entity type
    in the following order: 0D elements, edges, faces, volumes, balls.
    At each step the number of entities of a certain type is added to the
    total number of elements computed at the previous step - if the resulting
    number of elements does not exceed the size limit, the entities of
    this type are shown, otherwise the user is warned that some entities are not shown.

- <b>Quality Controls</b>
  - If you toggle <b>Display entity</b>, both faces and edges of an
    object will be displayed in the viewer by default.
  - If you toggle <b>Use precision</b> checkbox, you can display numbers in
    <b>Quality Control</b> diagrams at the necessary level of precision.
  - <b>Number of digits after point</b> - defines precision for
    <b>Quality Controls</b>. By default, numbers in <b>Quality Control</b>
    diagrams are presented as integers.
  - <b>Double nodes tolerance</b> defines the maximal distance between two
    mesh nodes, at which they are considered coincident by <b>Double nodes</b>
    quality control.

- <b>Display mode</b>
  - <b>Default display mode</b> - allows to set Wireframe, Shading, Nodes or Shrink
  presentation mode as default.

- <b>Representation of the 2D quadratic elements</b>
  - <b>Default mode of the 2D quadratic elements</b> combo-box - allows
    to select lines or arcs for representation of quadratic elements as default.
  - <b>Maximum Angle</b> - maximum deviation angle used by the
    application to build arcs.

- <b>Mesh export</b>
  - If you toggle <b>Automatically create groups for MED export</b> check-box,
    this operation will be carried out automatically.
  - <b>Show warning when exporting group</b> check-box - allows defining the 
    behavior of the warning when exporting a group.

- <b>Mesh computation</b>
  - <b>Show a computation result notification</b> combo-box allows to
    select the notification mode about a mesh computation result.
    There are 3 possible modes:
    - <b>Never</b> - do not show the result dialog at all;
    - <b>Errors only</b> - the result dialog will be shown if there were
      some errors during a mesh computation;
    - <b>Always</b> - show the result dialog after each mesh
      computation. This is a default mode.

- <b>Mesh information</b>
  - <b>Mesh element information</b> - change the way mesh element
    information is shown:
    - <b>Simple</b> - as a plain text
    - <b>Tree</b> - in a tree-like form
  - <b>Automatic nodes compute limit</b> - allows defining the size limit for the
    mesh groups for which the number of underlying nodes is calculated
    automatically. If the group size exceeds the value set in the preferences,
    the user will have to press \em Compute button explicitly. Zero value
    means "no limit". By default the value is set to 100 000 mesh elements.
  - <b>Automatic controls compute limit</b> - allows defining the size limit for the
    mesh elements for which the Aspect Ratio histogram is calculated
    automatically. If the mesh elements size exceeds the value set in the preferences,
    it is possible to press \b Compute button explicitly to calculate the histogram . Zero value
    means "no limit". By default the value is set to 3 000 mesh elements.
  - <b>Show details on groups in element information tab</b> - when
    this option is switched off (default), only the names of groups, to which the node
    or element belongs, are shown in the \ref mesh_element_info_anchor "Info Tab"
    tab of "Mesh Information" dialog box. If this option is
    switched on, the detailed information on groups is shown.
  - <b>Dump base information</b> - allows dumping base mesh information to the
    file, see \ref mesh_infos_page.
  - <b>Dump element information</b> - allows dumping element information to the
    file, see \ref mesh_infos_page.
  - <b>Dump additional information</b> - allows dumping additional mesh
    information to the file, see \ref mesh_infos_page.
  - <b>Dump controls information</b> - allows dumping quality mesh
    information to the file, see \ref mesh_infos_page.

- <b>Automatic Parameters</b>
  - <b>Ratio Bounding Box Diagonal / Max Size</b> - this parameter is
    used for automatic meshing. This is the ratio between the bounding box of the
    meshed object and the Max Size of segments.
  - <b>Default Number of Segments</b> - defines the default
    number of segments on each edge.

- <b>Mesh loading</b>
  - If <b>No mesh loading from study file at hypothesis modification</b>
    check-box is on, the mesh data will not be loaded from the study file
    when a hypothesis is modified. This allows  saving time by omitting
    loading data of a large mesh that is planned to be recomputed with other parameters.

- <b>Input fields precision</b>
  - <b>Length precision</b> - allows to adjust input precision of coordinates and dimensions.
  - <b>Angular precision</b> - allows to adjust input precision of angles.
  - <b>Length tolerance precision</b> - allows to adjust input precision of tolerance of coordinates and dimensions.
  - <b>Parametric precision</b> - allows to adjust input precision of parametric values.
  - <b>Area precision</b> - allows to adjust input precision of mesh element area.
  - <b>Volume precision</b> - allows to adjust input precision of mesh element volume.

- <b>Preview</b>
  - <b>Sub-shapes preview chunk size</b> - allows to limit the number
    of previewed sub-shapes shown in the hypotheses creation dialog boxes,
    for example "Reverse Edges" parameter of \ref number_of_segments_anchor "Number of segments" hypothesis.

- <b>Python Dump</b>
  - <b>Historical python dump</b> checkbox allows switching between
    \a Historical and \a Snapshot dump mode:
    - In \a Historical mode, Python Dump script includes all commands
      performed by SMESH engine.
    - In \a Snapshot mode, the commands relating to objects removed
      from the Study as well as the commands not influencing the
      current state of meshes are excluded from the script.
