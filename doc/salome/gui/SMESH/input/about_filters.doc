\page filters_page About filters

\b Filters allow picking only the mesh elements satisfying to a
specific condition or a set of conditions. Filters can be used to create
or edit mesh groups, remove elements from the mesh, control
mesh quality by different parameters, etc.

Several criteria can be combined together by using logical operators \a
AND and \a OR. In addition, a filter criterion can be reverted
using logical operator \a NOT.

Some filtering criteria use the functionality of \ref quality_page "mesh quality controls"
to filter mesh nodes / elements by specific characteristic (Area, Length, etc).

The functinality of mesh filters is available in both GUI and TUI
modes:

- In GUI, filters are available in some dialog boxes via
"Set Filters" button, clicking on which opens the dialog box
allowing to specify the list of filter criteria to be applied to the
current selection. See \subpage selection_filter_library_page page to learn more
about selection filters and their usage in GUI.

- In Python scripts, filters can be used to choose only some mesh
  entities (nodes or elements) for the operations, which require the
  list of entities as input parameter (create/modify group, remove
  nodes/elements, etc) and for the operations, which accept objects
  (groups, sub-meshes) as input parameter. The page \ref
  tui_filters_page provides examples of the filters usage in Python
  scripts.
