\page filters_page About filters

\b Filters allows to pick only those mesh elements which satisfy to
specific condition or set of conditions. Filters can be used to create
or edit mesh groups, remove elements from the mesh object, control
mesh quality by different parameters, etc.

Several filters can be combined together by using logical operators \a
AND and \a OR. In addition, applied filter criterion can be reverted
using logical operator \a NOT.

Mesh filters use the functionality of \ref quality_page "mesh quality controls"
to filter mesh nodes / elements by specific characteristic (Area, Length, etc).

The functinality of mesh filters is available in both GUI and TUI
modes:

- In GUI, filters are available in some dialog boxes via an additional
"Set Filtes" button, clicking on which opens specific dialog box
allowing to specify the list of filter criterions to be applied to the
current selection. Follow to the \subpage selection_filter_library_page page to learn more
about selection filters and their usage in GUI.

- In Python scripts, filters can be used to choose only some of mesh
  enitities (nodes and/or elements) for the operations which require
  list of the entities as input parameter (create/modify group, remove
  nodes/elements, etc). The page \ref tui_filters_page provides
  examples of the filters usage in the Python scripts.
