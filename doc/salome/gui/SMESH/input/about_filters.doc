\page filters_page About filters

\b Filters allow picking only the mesh elements satisfying to a
specific condition or a set of conditions. Filters can be used to create
or edit mesh groups, remove elements from the mesh object, control
mesh quality by different parameters, etc.

Several filters can be combined together by using logical operators \a
AND and \a OR. In addition, applied filter criterion can be reverted
using logical operator \a NOT.

Mesh filters use the functionality of \ref quality_page "mesh quality controls"
to filter mesh nodes / elements by specific characteristic (Area, Length, etc).

The functinality of mesh filters is available in both GUI and TUI
modes:

- In GUI, filters are available in some dialog boxes via an additional
"Set Filters" button, clicking on which opens the dialog box
allowing to specify the list of filter criterions to be applied to the
current selection. See \subpage selection_filter_library_page page to learn more
about selection filters and their usage in GUI.

- In Python scripts, filters can be used to choose only some mesh
  entities (nodes and/or elements) for the operations, which require the
  list of entities as input parameter (create/modify group, remove
  nodes/elements, etc). The page \ref tui_filters_page provides
  examples of the filters usage in Python scripts.
