<li><b>Coincident elements</b> is a list of groupes of elements for
merging. All elements of each group will form one after the operation.

<center>adds to the group the element selected in the viewer.</center>
<br>
\image html remove.png
<center>removes from the group the selected element.</center>
<br>
\image html sort.png
<center>moves the selected element to the first position in the
group. This means that all other elements will be merged into this
one.</center>
<br>
</li>
<li>To confirm your choice click \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button.</li>
</ol>

In this picture you see a triangle which coincides with one of the
elements of the mesh. After we apply <b>Merge Elements</b> functionality, the
triangle will be completely merged with the mesh.
