\page constructing_submeshes_page Constructing sub-meshes

Sub-mesh is a mesh on a geometrical sub-object created with algorithms
and/or hypotheses other than the algorithms and hypotheses assigned to
the parent mesh on the parent object.
<br><br>
If a geometrical sub-object belongs to several geometrical objects
having different meshes or sub-meshes, it will be meshed with the
hypotheses of a sub-mesh of a lower dimension.<br>
For example, a face of a box is meshed with a sub-mesh using algorithms
and hypotheses other than the parent mesh on the whole box. The face
and the box share four edges, which will be meshed with algorithms and
hypotheses of the sub-mesh on the face, because the face is a 2D object
while the box is a 3D object.  <br>
 If the dimensions are the same, an arbitrary algorithm/hypothesis
 will be used. This means that an edge shared by two faces each having
 its own different sub-mesh, will be meshed using algorithms and
 hypotheses of any of the two, chosen randomly. This indeterminacy can
 be fixed by defining \ref submesh_order_anchor "Sub-mesh priority".
<br>

\n Construction of a sub-mesh consists of:
<ul>
<li>Selecting a mesh which will encapsulate your sub-mesh</li>
<li>Selecting a geometrical object for meshing</li>
<li>Applying one or several previously described 
\ref about_hypo_page "hypotheses" and 
\ref basic_meshing_algos_page "meshing algorithms" which will be used
at computation of this sub-mesh</li>
</ul>

<br><em>To construct a sub-mesh:</em>
\par
From the \b Mesh menu select <b>Create Sub-mesh</b> or click <em>"Create
Sum-mesh"</em> button in the toolbar.

<center><em>"Create Sub-mesh" button</em></center>

\par
The following dialog box will appear:

\image html createmesh-inv2.png

\par
It allows to define the \b Name, the parent \b Mesh and the \b
Geometry (e.g. a face if the parent mesh has been built on box) of the
sub-mesh. You can define algorithms and hypotheses in the same way as
in \ref constructing_meshes_page "Create mesh" menu.

\par
In the Object Browser the structure of the new sub-mesh will be
displayed as follows:

\par
It contains:
<ul>
<li>a reference to the geometrical object on the basis of which the sub-mesh has been constructed;</li>
<li><b>Applied hypotheses</b> folder containing the references to the
hypotheses applied to the construction of the sub-mesh;</li>
<li><b>Applied algorithms</b> folder containing the references to the
algorithms applied to the construction of the sub-mesh.</li>
</ul>

<br><b>See Also</b> a sample TUI Script of a 
\ref tui_construction_submesh "Construct Sub-mesh" operation.
