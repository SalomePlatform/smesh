\page constructing_submeshes_page Constructing submeshes

\n Construction of a submesh consists of:
<ul>
<li>Selecting a mesh which will encapsulate your submesh</li>
<li>Selecting a geometrical object for meshing</li>
<li>Applying one or several previously 
\ref about_hypo_page "hypotheses" and 
\ref basic_meshing_algos_page "meshing algorithms" which will be used
at computation of this submesh</li>
</ul>

<br><em>To construct a submesh:</em>
\par
From the \b Mesh menu select <b>Local Hyp.</b> or click <em>"Create
Sum-mesh"</em> button in the toolbar.

<center><em>"Create Sum-mesh" button</em></center>

\par
The following dialog box will appear:

\par
It allows to define the \b Name, the parent \b Mesh and the \b
Geometry (e.g. a face if the parent mesh has been built on box) of the
submesh. You can define algorithms and hypotheses in the same way as
in \ref constructing_meshes_page "Create mesh" menu.

\par
In the Object Browser the structure of the new submesh will be
displayed as follows:

\par
It contains:
<ul>
<li>a reference to the geometrical object on the basis of which the submesh has been constructed;</li>
<li><b>Applied hypotheses</b> folder containing the references to the
hypotheses applied to the construction of the submesh;</li>
<li><b>Applied algorithms</b> folder containing the references to the
algorithms applied to the construction of the submesh.</li>
</ul>

<br><b>See Also</b> a sample TUI Script of a 
\ref tui_construction_submesh "Construct Submesh" operation.
