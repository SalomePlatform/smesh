<h2>Max Element Area</h2>

<b>Max Element Area</b> hypothesis is applied for meshing of 2D faces
composing your geometrical object. Definition of this hypothesis
consists of setting the <b>maximum area</b> of meshing elements (depending on
the chosen meshing algorithm it can be <b>triangles</b> or <b>quadrangles</b>),
which will compose the mesh of these 2D faces.

<h2>Length from Edges</h2>

<b>Length from edges</b> hypothesis builds 2D mesh segments having a
length calculated as an average edge length for a given wire.

<h2>Quadrangle parameters</h2>

<b>Quadrangle parameters</b> is a hypothesis for Quadrangle (Mapping).

<b>Base vertex</b> parameter allows using Quadrangle (Mapping)
algorithm for meshing of triangular faces. In this case it is
necessary to select a vertex, which will be used as the fourth edge
(degenerated).

This parameter can be also used to mesh a segment of a circular face.
Please, consider that there is a limitation on the selection of the
vertex for the faces built with the angle > 180 degrees (see the picture).

In this case, selection of a wrong vertex for the <b>Base vertex</b>
parameter will generate a wrong mesh. The picture below
shows the good (left) and the bad (right) results of meshing.

<b>Type</b> parameter has sense on faces with different number of
segments on opposite sides. The following types are available:

<ul>
<li><b>Standard</b> means the default case, triangles and quadrangles
    are possible along the longest sides (in the refinement area).</li>
<li><b>Triangle preference</b> forces building only triangles in the
    refinement area for transition to higher number of segments.
    <i>This type corresponds to <b>Triangle Preference</b> additional
    hypothesis, which is obsolete now.</i></li>
<li><b>Quadrangle preference</b> forces building only quadrangles for
    transition to higher number of segments. This hypothesis has one
    restriction on its work: the total quantity of segments on all
    four sides of the face must be even (divisible by 2).</li>
    <i>This type corresponds to <b>Quadrangle Preference</b>
    additional hypothesis, which is obsolete now.</i></li>
<li><b>Quadrangle preference (reversed)</b> works like
    <b>Quadrangle preference</b> (and with same restriction), but
    transition is made near the sides with smaller number of
    segments.</li>
<li><b>Reduced</b> type forces building only quadrangles, transition
    to other number of segments is made layer by layer. This type has
    a limitation on number of segments: two opposite edges must have
    the same number of segments, two another must have even difference
    between their numbers of segments.</li>
</ul>

\ref tui_quadrangle_parameters "Quadrangle Parameters" hypothesis.
