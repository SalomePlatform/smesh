<h2>Max Element Area</h2>

<b>Max Element Area</b> hypothesis is applied for meshing of 2D faces
composing your geometrical object. Definition of this hypothesis
consists of setting the <b>maximum area</b> of meshing elements (depending on
the chosen meshing algorithm it can be <b>triangles</b> or <b>quadrangles</b>),
which will compose the mesh of these 2D faces.

<h2>Length from Edges</h2>

<b>Length from edges</b> hypothesis builds 2D mesh segments having a
length calculated as an average edge length for a given wire.

<b>See Also</b> a sample TUI Script of a 
\ref tui_length_from_edges "Length from Edges" hypothesis operation.

\anchor quadrangle_preference_anchor
<h2>Quadrangle Preference</h2>

This algorithm can be used only together with Quadrangle (Mapping)
algorithm. It allows to build quadrangular meshes even if the number
of nodes at the opposite edges of a meshed face is not equal,
otherwise this mesh will contain some triangular elements.
