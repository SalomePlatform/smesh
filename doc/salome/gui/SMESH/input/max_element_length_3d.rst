*******************
Element Diameter 3D
*******************

This quality control criterion consists in calculation of the maximal length of edges and diagonals of 3D mesh elements (tetrahedrons, pyramids, etc). For polyhedra the value is always zero. 

*To apply the Element Diameter 3D quality criterion to your mesh:*
