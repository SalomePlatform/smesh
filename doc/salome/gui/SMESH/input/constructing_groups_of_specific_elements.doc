\n In MESH you can easily construct groups of specific elements (nodes,
edges, faces or volumes) which will be taken from a definite submesh.

<em>To construct a group of specific elements:</em>

\par
Right-click on a submesh in the Object Browser and choose the
<b>Construct Group</b> item or select your submesh in the Object Browser and
in the \b Mesh menu choose the <b>Construct Group</b> item. MESH will construct
several groups consisting of elements of the definite type: nodes,
edges, faces or volumes.
