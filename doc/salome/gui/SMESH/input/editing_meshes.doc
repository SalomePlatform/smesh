\page editing_meshes_page Editing Meshes

\n After you have created a mesh or sub-mesh with definite applied
meshing algorithms and hypotheses you can edit your mesh by \b assigning other
algorithms and/or hypotheses or \b unassigning the applied hypotheses and
algorithms. The editing proceeds in the same way as 
\ref create_mesh_anchor "Mesh Creation".

You can also change values for the current hypothesis by clicking the
<em>"Edit Hypothesis"</em> button.

Mesh entities generated before using changed hypotheses are automatically removed.

See how the mesh constructed on a geometrical object
changes if we apply different meshing parameters to it.

\ref tui_editing_mesh "Edit Mesh" operation.
