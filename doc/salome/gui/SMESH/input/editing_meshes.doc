\n After you have created a mesh or submesh with definite applied
hypotheses and algorithms you can edit your mesh by \b assigning new
hypotheses and algorithms or \b unassigning the applied hypotheses and
algorithms. The editing proceeds in the same way as <b>Mesh
Creation</b>.

You can also change values for the current hypothesis by clicking the
<em>"Edit Hypothesis"</em> button.

See how a mesh constructed on one and the same geometrical object
changes if we apply different algorithms to it.
