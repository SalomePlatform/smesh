Using this dialog you can customize different properties of the mesh visualization
parameters.

The GUI elements in the "Properties" dialog box are grouped according
to the entity types of mesh data. If some data entities are not
present in the mesh object, the corresponding GUI elements are not
shown.

- \b Nodes:
  - \b Color - color of nodes.
  - \b Type and \b Scale - these options allow changing of the nodes
    representation (see \subpage point_marker_page "Point Marker" page
    for more details).
- <b>Edges / wireframe</b>:
  - \b Color - color of element borders in wireframe mode.
  - \b Width - width of lines (edges and borders of elements
    in wireframe mode).
- \b Faces:
  - \b Front - surface color of face elements (seen in shading mode).
  - \b Back - backside surface color of face elements. Use slider to
    select this color generated on base of the \b Face color by
    changing its brightness and saturation. 
- \b Volumes:
  - \b Normal - surface color of normal volume elements (seen in shading mode).
  - \b Reversed - surface color of volume elements. Use slider to
    select this color generated on base of the \b Normal color by
    changing its brightness and saturation. 
- \b Outlines:
  - \b Color - color of element borders in shading mode.
  - \b Width - width of outlines (borders of elements
    in shading mode).
- <b>0D elements</b>:
  - \b Color - color of 0D elements.
  - \b Size - size of 0D elements.
- \b Balls:
  - \b Color - color of discrete ball elements.
  - \b Size - size of discrete ball elements.
- <b>Orientation vectors</b>:
  - \b Color - color of orientation vectors.
  - \b Scale - size of orientation vectors.
  - <b>3D vectors</b> - allows to choose between 2D planar and 3D vectors.
- <b>Shrink coef.</b> - relative space of elements compared to gaps between
  them in shrink mode.
