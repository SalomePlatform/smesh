\n MESH modules allows you to work with <b>Quadratic Elements</b>.

Quadratic Edge is not a straight but a broken line and can be defined
by three points: first, middle and last. All more complex \b Quadratic
\b Elements differ from ordinary ones in that they consist of Quadratic
Edges.

<em>To add a quadratic element to your mesh:</em>
<ol>
<li>Select your mesh in the Object Browser or in the 3D viewer.</li>

<li>From the \b Modification menu choose the \b Add item and select
one of the following:

\note All dialogs intended for adding quadratic elements to mesh provide a possibility
to add these elements to the specified group (or to create the group if it doesn't exist).
<b>Add to group</b> box allows to choose an existing group for created element or
to specify a name for new group.

To create any <b>Quadratic Element</b> specify the nodes which will form your
triangle by selecting them in the 3D viewer with pressed Shift
button. Their numbers will appear in the dialog box as <b>Corner Nodes</b>
(alternatively you can just input numbers in this field without
selection).The edges formed by the corner nodes will appear in the
table. To define the middle nodes for each edge double-click on the
respective field and input the number of the node. All edges and the
object formed by them will be displayed in the Object browser. When
all edges are defined you will be able to click \b Apply or <b>Apply and Close</b> button to
add the element to the mesh.

\b Reverse button for Quadratic Edges switches the first and the last
nodes. For all other elements it reverses the element.
