\page over_constrained_volumes_page Over-constrained volumes

\n This mesh quality control highlights volumes sharing only one border with other volumes.
In other words, the volumes having all their nodes on the external border of the mesh are highlighted.

\note The highlighted volumes are actually over-constrained only if, at the computation time, 
the boundary conditions on the borders where the nodes are located are all Dirichlet boundary conditions.

In this picture the over-constrained volume is displayed in red.
