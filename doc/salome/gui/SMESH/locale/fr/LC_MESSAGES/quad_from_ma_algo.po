"Medial Axis Projection algorithm can be used for meshing faces with "
"sinuous borders and a channel-like shape, for which it can be difficult "
"to define 1D hypotheses such that to obtain a good shape of resulting "
"quadrangles. The algorithm can be also applied to faces with ring "
"topology, which can be viewed as a closed 'channel'. In the latter case "
"radial discretization of a ring can be specified by using **Number of "
"Layers** or **Distribution of Layers** hypothesis."

"The algorithm provides proper shape of quadrangles by constructing Medial"
" Axis between sinuous borders of the face and using it to discretize the "
"borders. (Shape of quadrangles can be not perfect at locations where "
"opposite sides of a 'channel' are far from being parallel.)"
