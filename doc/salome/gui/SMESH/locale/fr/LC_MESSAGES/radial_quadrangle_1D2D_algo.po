"This algorithm applies to the meshing of 2D shapes under the following "
"conditions: the face must be a full ellipse or a part of ellipse (i.e. "
"the number of edges is less or equal to 3 and one of them is an ellipse "
"curve). The resulting mesh consists of triangles (near the center point) "
"and quadrangles."

"This algorithm is optionally parametrized by the hypothesis indicating "
"the number of mesh layers along the radius. The distribution of layers "
"can be set with any 1D Hypothesis. If the face boundary includes radial "
"edges, this distribution is applied to the longest radial edge. If the "
"face boundary does not include radial edges, this distribution is applied"
" to the longest virtual radial edge. The distribution is applied to the "
"longest radial edge starting from its end lying on the elliptic curve."
