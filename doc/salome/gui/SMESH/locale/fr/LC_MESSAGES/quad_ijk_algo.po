"The algorithm treats any face as quadrangle. If a face is bound by more "
"than four edges, four most sharp vertices are considered as corners of "
"the quadrangle and all edges between these vertices are treated as "
"quadrangle sides. In the case of three edges, the vertex specified by the"
" user is considered as a fourth degenerated side of the quadrangle."

"To get an all-quadrangle mesh you have to carefully define 1D hypotheses "
"on edges of a face. To get a **structured** mesh you have to provide "
"equal number of segments on opposite sides of the quadrangle. If this "
"condition is not respected, the algorithm by default (without a "
"hypothesis) creates a **quad-dominant** mesh with triangles located near "
"the side with the maximal number of segments. However, you can get an "
"**all-quadrangle** mesh in this case by using "
":ref:`hypo_quad_params_anchor` hypothesis to specify how to make "
"transition mesh between opposite sides with different number of segments,"
" provided that certain conditions are respected. In any case the total "
"number of segments must be even. To use *Reduced* transition method, "
"there must be an equal number of segments on one pair of opposite sides."
