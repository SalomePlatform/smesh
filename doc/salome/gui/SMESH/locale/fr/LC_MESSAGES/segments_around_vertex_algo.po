"**Segments around Vertex** algorithm is considered to be a 0D meshing "
"algorithm, but, of course, it doesn't mesh vertices. It allows to define "
"the local size of the segments in the neighborhood of a certain vertex. "
"If we assign this algorithm to a geometrical object of higher dimension, "
"it applies to all its vertices."

"Length of segments near vertex is defined by **Length Near Vertex** "
"hypothesis. This hypothesis is used by :ref:`a1d_algos_anchor` \"Wire "
"Discretization\" or :ref:`a1d_algos_anchor` \"Composite Side "
"Discretization\" algorithms as follows: a geometrical edge is discretized"
" according to a 1D hypotheses and then nodes near vertices are modified "
"to assure the segment length required by **Length Near Vertex** "
"hypothesis."
